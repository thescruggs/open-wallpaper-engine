# Report protocol v1

## Purpose

`docs/Scene-Rendering-Plan.md` §5.3 ("Structured reports") calls for
versioned `scene-inspection-v1` and `scene-render-report-v1` JSON records
delivered over "a dedicated inherited report socket/file descriptor with a
versioned length-delimited envelope, not worker stdout or stderr" — moving
structured reporting off the channels a renderer/inspector process already
uses for other things (stdout carries the v1 input-acknowledgement contract;
stderr is a bounded diagnostic ring, never parsed as data). This document is
that envelope's wire format, frozen for `kwe-report-protocol` (SR-1a). The
containment/FD plumbing that gets a byte stream from a child process to this
codec, and the malformed/missing/duplicate policy for the one-shot
`scene.inspect` path specifically, is SR-1b (implemented); the broader
daemon-side policy for what a malformed/missing/duplicate/late report means
for an APPLY decision (a long-lived renderer worker, not the one-shot
inspector) is SR-1c.

Cross-references: `docs/SCENE_CAPABILITIES.md` (the frozen v1 capability ID
taxonomy this record's `required`/`detected` arrays draw from);
`docs/SUPERVISOR_API_V1.md` (the daemon's existing JSON-line control-socket
API, `scene.inspect` in particular — unrelated transport, same daemon); and
`docs/SHADER_HELPER_PROTOCOL_V1.md` (SR-3a: the killable shader-compile
helper reuses this SAME 12-byte `KWR1` frame codec, on both directions of
its own stdin/stdout channels, under a separate kind namespace — kinds 16-18
below — and its own `StreamCaps`; the wire FORMAT and this crate's codec are
shared, the channel semantics are not).

## Codec vs. policy

This crate (`kwe-report-protocol`) only defines and codecs bytes:

- the frame wire format (below);
- `FrameReader`, which surfaces frames in the order they arrive and
  enforces only the stream-shape bounds (frame count, total bytes, per-frame
  bytes) — never a semantic judgment about what a duplicate or out-of-order
  frame means;
- `validate_inspection`, a pure function from bytes to a validated
  `scene-inspection-v1` JSON value or a typed shape/digest error.

Everything about what to DO with a stream — is a second `scene-inspection-v1`
frame a protocol violation (duplicate) or a legitimate resend; does an apply
gate on a malformed report; what timeout makes a report "late" — is SR-1c's
daemon-side policy, built on top of this codec, not inside it. This split
mirrors the rest of the workspace's protocol crates
(`kwe-frame-protocol`/`kwe-input-protocol` codec bytes/shared-memory layout;
the daemon and worker own what those bytes mean).

## Report FD convention

- The daemon creates a pipe, keeps the read end, and passes the write end's
  fd number to the child as `--report-fd <n>` (the child `dup2`s its own
  write end onto `<n>` before it needs it, then closes the original).
- The daemon owns the read end exclusively: no other code reads from it, and
  it is closed (along with the child's write end, via normal process
  teardown) on every generation change — a retired worker's report stream is
  never read after its replacement is promoted.
- The child writes zero or more frames, then closes its write end (a normal,
  intentional close — not a crash) once it has nothing more to report for
  this generation.
- stdout's existing input-acknowledgement contract (`kwe-input-protocol`,
  newline-delimited JSON `input_ack` messages) is unchanged — reports do
  not travel there, and nothing about moving reports to a dedicated FD
  touches the stdout contract.

**Implemented (SR-1b):** the one-shot `scene.inspect` path
(`crates/kwe-daemon/src/inspect.rs`'s `run_inspection`/`supervise`).
`kwe-scene-inspector` gained `--report-fd <n>` (absent: unchanged v0-on-
stdout behavior; present: nothing on stdout, one `scene-inspection-v1` frame
on `n`). The daemon creates the pipe with `libc::pipe2(..., O_CLOEXEC)` and,
in the child's `pre_exec`, `dup2`s the write end onto a fixed fd 3 —
inserted into the exact same closure that already runs
`setpgid`/`PR_SET_PDEATHSIG`/the parent-pid check/`PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS`/
`apply_resource_limits` (mirroring `supervisor::spawn_worker`'s pre_exec
block) — then reads the resulting stream with `FrameReader` once the child
has exited 0. `docs/SUPERVISOR_API_V1.md`'s "Scene inspection" section is
the RPC-facing description of the resulting reason codes.

**Not yet implemented:** the long-lived RENDERER worker's own report stream
(`supervisor::spawn_worker`, `renderer.start`) is a separate, still-future
wiring untouched by SR-1b. `report-late` (only meaningful once there is an
apply-window deadline to be late against, which the one-shot inspector call
does not have — it has only its own wall-clock timeout, already `timeout`)
and `report-unavailable` (defined below for a renderer WORKER predating the
report FD; the one-shot inspector's own old-binary skew resolves
differently — see "Version-skew matrix") remain unimplemented/unused by
SR-1b.

Reason codes a future renderer-worker report slice is expected to use
(named here so this document is the single place a future reader learns the
full intended vocabulary, even where only the inspector path implements it
today — SR-1c scoped itself to the apply gate, not this wiring; see
`docs/SR1.md`'s SR-1c entry):

| Reason code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `report-malformed` | A frame or its payload failed a typed check (bad magic/flags/reserved, an oversize/truncated frame, a stream-cap violation, or a `scene-inspection-v1` payload that fails `validate_inspection`). Implemented (SR-1b, `scene.inspect`). |
| `report-missing` | The child exited 0 but its report stream contained zero frames of the expected kind (either no frames at all, or only frames of a kind the daemon does not act on — e.g. `Unknown`). Implemented (SR-1b, `scene.inspect`). |
| `report-duplicate` | A second frame of a kind that must appear at most once in a stream arrived (daemon policy, not a codec-level concept — see "Codec vs. policy"). Implemented (SR-1b, `scene.inspect`). |
| `report-late` | A report arrived after the daemon's own deadline for it (a generation/apply-window boundary, not a wire-level timeout this crate knows about). Not yet implemented — no code path has an apply-window deadline to compare against yet. |
| `report-unavailable` | A renderer WORKER predates the report FD entirely (an old binary that never gets `--report-fd`); the daemon must not reconstruct a policy decision from stdout/stderr in this case (plan §5.3). Not yet implemented (no renderer-worker report stream exists yet); the one-shot inspector's analogous old-binary case resolves as `inspector-failed` instead — see "Version-skew matrix". |

### Version-skew matrix (SR-1b: one case; SR-1d: the fuller matrix below)

Every combination of daemon/inspector vintage and calling context this
crate's report-FD path can actually be exercised under, and the test that
proves each row. `kwe-scene-inspector` and `kwe-daemon` ship in the same
package and version together — every "old"/"new" pairing below is a
partial-upgrade window (a half-updated package, or an operator pointing
`--inspector` at a stray old binary), not a supported long-term
compatibility mode.

| Combination | Behavior | Proof |
|---|---|---|
| New daemon + new inspector (same package) | `--report-fd 3` passed and honored; exactly one `scene-inspection-v1` frame arrives, digest-verified, stdout empty. | `crates/kwe-daemon/src/inspect.rs`'s `valid_v1_report_passes_through_verbatim_digest_verified`; `crates/kwe-scene-inspector/tests/report_fd.rs`'s `report_fd_present_emits_one_validated_frame_and_empty_stdout`. |
| New daemon + OLD inspector (partial upgrade window) | The old binary's argparse rejects the daemon's unconditional `--report-fd 3` as an unrecognized argument — a usage error to stderr, exit 2. The daemon never falls back to the old stdout contract: this resolves `inspector-failed`, usage text in `stderr_tail`. Through the SR-1c apply gate this is inspection outcome `unknown`, so `wallpaper.apply` for a scene PROCEEDS with `{"inspection": "unavailable", "inspection_reason": "inspector-failed"}` attached (decision (b): infrastructure failure never blocks Apply). | Inspect level: `crates/kwe-daemon/src/inspect.rs`'s `old_inspector_without_report_fd_support_is_inspector_failed` (SR-1b). Apply level (SR-1d, closes the gap): `crates/kwe-daemon/src/main.rs`'s `scene_apply_gate_proceeds_with_an_old_inspector_binary`. |
| OLD daemon + new inspector | The old daemon never passes `--report-fd` at all; the inspector's flag is optional, so it falls back to its pre-SR-1b contract: the `scene-feature-inventory-v0` record on stdout, byte-identical to before. | `crates/kwe-scene-inspector/tests/report_fd.rs`'s `no_report_fd_flag_emits_the_v0_line_on_stdout`; `scripts/smoke-scene-corpus.sh` (`KWE_RUN_SCENE_CORPUS_SMOKE=1`), which also drives the inspector with no `--report-fd`. |
| Direct script/manual use (no daemon at all) | Same absent-flag path as "old daemon" above — the inspector cannot distinguish an old daemon from a human or `scripts/scene-corpus-inventory.sh` invoking it directly; stdout v0. | `scripts/smoke-scene-corpus.sh` (`KWE_RUN_SCENE_CORPUS_SMOKE=1`, `./scripts/check.sh`'s opt-in corpus smoke gate) — the corpus runner IS this calling context. |
| Daemon restart / process death mid-inspection | `documented-only`. The inspector's `pre_exec` closure (`crates/kwe-daemon/src/inspect.rs`, the block installing `setpgid(0, 0)` / `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG` `SIGKILL` / the parent-pid check / `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS`, mirroring `supervisor::spawn_worker`'s containment exactly — SR-0b) means the inspector dies with its parent: no orphan survives a daemon crash or restart, and the daemon's own copy of the report pipe's read end is closed as part of process teardown, so nothing is left holding it open. No new test: this is the same containment contract SR-0b already established and the supervisor's own worker tests already cover for the long-lived case; the one-shot inspector reuses it verbatim rather than re-deriving it. |
| Inspector binary replaced on disk mid-uptime (package upgrade, daemon not restarted) | The daemon spawns whatever is at the configured `inspector_path` at call time — a plain path-based `Command::new`, no cached `File`/fd/handle to the binary held between calls. Overwriting the same path between two inspections is picked up by the very next one, no daemon action required. | `crates/kwe-daemon/src/inspect.rs`'s `replaced_binary_on_disk_is_picked_up_without_caching` (SR-1d, new: two inspections against the same configured path, the script rewritten between them, asserts the second call's `inspector.build` marker is the NEW content). |
| Report FD vs stdout both written by a misbehaving new inspector | `finalize` (`crates/kwe-daemon/src/inspect.rs`) only ever parses the accumulated report-FD bytes — stdout content never reaches the result, by construction (the field it returns is built from `report_bytes`, not from anything captured off stdout), so "report wins" is a `documented-only` structural fact, not something a test needs to race. Stdout is still drained and bounded defensively (pipe-backpressure safety for a misbehaving/old-format child), independently of whatever the report FD carries. | `documented-only` (see `finalize`'s signature/body) for "report wins"; `crates/kwe-daemon/src/inspect.rs`'s `flooded_stdout_is_also_refused_as_report_oversize` (SR-1b) for "stdout flood still bounds". |
| Apply retry after refusal, with a changed build/inspector | No inspection cache (SR-1c decision (c)): `retry: true` re-runs the gate against whatever `inspect_config` currently resolves to, so a fixed inspector (or a fixed scene) applies on retry instead of replaying the first refusal. | `crates/kwe-daemon/src/main.rs`'s `scene_apply_gate_retry_re_runs_the_gate_no_negative_caching` (SR-1c). |

SR-1d intentionally does not add a renderer-worker row: the long-lived
renderer worker's own report-FD stream (`report-late`,
`report-unavailable` in the renderer-worker sense) does not exist yet — see
the reason-code table above and `docs/SR1.md`'s SR-1c entry ("Out of
scope"). SR-1d closes the gaps in the one-shot inspector's matrix only.

## Wire format

A report stream is a unidirectional child→daemon byte stream. It is a
sequence of frames; nothing precedes the first frame and nothing follows the
last one except EOF (the child closing its write end).

Frame = a 12-byte header, then `payload_len` bytes of payload.

| Bytes | Field | Value |
|---|---|---|
| 0..4 | magic | `b"KWR1"` |
| 4 | `kind` | `u8` — see Kinds below |
| 5 | `flags` | `u8`, MUST be `0` in v1 — nonzero is a typed error (`BadFlags`), not a silently-ignored bit field |
| 6..8 | reserved | `u16`, little-endian, MUST be `0` — nonzero is a typed error (`BadReserved`) |
| 8..12 | `payload_len` | `u32`, little-endian, `<= 65536` |
| 12..12+payload_len | payload | `payload_len` raw bytes |

All multi-byte integers are little-endian, matching every other binary
protocol in this workspace (`kwe-frame-protocol`'s shared-frame header).
`flags` and the reserved bytes being hard requirements (not "ignore unknown
bits") is deliberate: v1 has no defined flag semantics, so a nonzero value
can only mean either a version this reader does not understand or a
corrupted stream, and both cases should fail typed rather than silently
proceed as if the flag meant nothing.

## Kinds

| `kind` | Name | Payload | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `scene-inspection-v1` | JSON, `validate_inspection`-checked | Defined by this document |
| 2 | `scene-render-report-v1` | JSON | Reserved. Its producer arrives with the render-report slices (plan §5.3's "phase and typed failure/recovery action", frame timing, etc.); this codec already carries kind 2 opaquely (the payload passes through `Frame.payload` untouched), so no codec change is needed when that producer lands — only a schema/validator, the same shape `validate_inspection` is for kind 1. |
| 3-15 | — | — | Unused, reserved for future report-FD kinds (this namespace). |
| 16 | `shader-compile-request-v1` | JSON | SR-3a. Belongs to the shader helper's SEPARATE stdin/stdout namespace, not the report-FD stream this document otherwise describes — see `docs/SHADER_HELPER_PROTOCOL_V1.md` for the full schema. |
| 17 | `shader-compile-response-v1` | JSON | SR-3a, same namespace as kind 16. |
| 18 | `spirv-chunk-v1` | raw binary, repeatable | SR-3a, same namespace; reserved, no producer yet. |
| anything else | — | opaque | `FrameReader` reads the frame (so the stream stays correctly positioned for the next one), returns it as `Frame { kind: FrameKind::Unknown(n), payload }`, and does not attempt to interpret the payload. This is what makes the wire format additive: a daemon built against this document can read a stream from a future writer that emits a kind it has never heard of, without losing its place in the stream or corrupting its accounting of the stream caps below. Whether an `Unknown` frame in a given stream is fine (forward-compatible metadata) or a protocol violation (SR-1c never expects a kind 3 yet) is daemon policy, not this crate's job. |

Duplicate-kind policy (e.g. two `kind = 1` frames in one stream) is
explicitly daemon policy (`report-duplicate` above), not a codec concern:
`FrameReader::next_frame` returns every well-formed frame it reads, in
arrival order, with no memory of which kinds it has already seen. SR-1c
decides, at the daemon layer, whether a repeated kind is acceptable.

## Stream caps (reader-enforced)

`FrameReader` enforces two STREAM-level bounds (frame count, total payload
bytes) itself, independent of anything the payload claims about itself, plus
one UNIVERSAL per-frame bound that no `StreamCaps` value can relax:

| Cap | Value | Constant | Configurable? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Frames per stream | 16 | `MAX_FRAMES_PER_STREAM` | Yes — `StreamCaps::max_frames` |
| Total payload bytes per stream | 1 MiB (1,048,576) | `MAX_TOTAL_PAYLOAD_BYTES` | Yes — `StreamCaps::max_total_payload_bytes` |
| Payload bytes per frame | 64 KiB (65,536) | `MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES` | No — universal, checked unconditionally |

**SR-3a:** the two stream-level bounds above were fixed constants through
SR-1/SR-2; `FrameReader::new(reader)` still enforces exactly those values
(`StreamCaps::REPORT`, byte-identical to the pre-SR-3a behavior — see
`new_and_with_caps_report_are_byte_identical`), but a caller with different
needs can now construct `FrameReader::with_caps(reader, StreamCaps { ... })`
instead. The shader helper (`docs/SHADER_HELPER_PROTOCOL_V1.md`) is the
first other caller: `StreamCaps::SHADER_REQUEST` (4 frames / 1 MiB) for its
stdin, `StreamCaps::SHADER_RESPONSE` (132 frames / 8 MiB) for its stdout.
The per-frame cap is unaffected by any of this — every `StreamCaps` value
still refuses a >64 KiB single frame the same way.

An `Unknown`-kind frame still counts against every configured stream-level
cap — a flood of frames in a kind this reader does not recognize is not a
way around the bounds, regardless of which `StreamCaps` a reader was built
with.

Per plan §9 ("Every bound defines behavior at `limit-1`, `limit`, and
`limit+1`: accept, degrade, refuse, or terminate"), the behavior at each
boundary, and the crate test that proves it:

| Bound | limit-1 | limit | limit+1 | Test |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Frames per stream | 15: accept | 16: accept | 17: `FrameCountExceeded` | `frame_count_cap_is_enforced_at_the_boundary` |
| Total payload bytes | just under 1 MiB: accept | exactly 1 MiB: accept | over 1 MiB: `TotalBytesExceeded` | `total_payload_cap_is_enforced_at_the_boundary` |
| Payload bytes per frame | 65,535: accept | 65,536: accept | 65,537: `PayloadOversize` | `payload_len_cap_is_enforced_at_the_boundary` |

One numeric coincidence worth documenting explicitly:
`MAX_FRAMES_PER_STREAM * MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES == MAX_TOTAL_PAYLOAD_BYTES`
exactly (16 * 64 KiB = 1 MiB). This means a stream cannot exceed the
total-byte cap without also being at frame 17 or later — the two caps are
not independent at the boundary. `FrameReader::next_frame` checks the byte
cap before the frame-count cap specifically so `TotalBytesExceeded` stays
independently reachable (a stream of 16 max-size frames plus one more small
frame reports `TotalBytesExceeded`, not `FrameCountExceeded`, even though it
is technically also the 17th frame); a stream of 17+ frames that never
approaches the byte cap still reports `FrameCountExceeded` as expected,
since its running total stays low. See the test's own comment for the
worked example.

## `scene-inspection-v1` schema

`scene-inspection-v1` is SR-0's draft `scene-feature-inventory-v0`
(`docs/SCENE_CAPABILITIES.md`) frozen and extended for the report FD. It
differs from v0 in exactly three ways:

1. `"schema"` is `"scene-inspection-v1"` instead of
   `"scene-feature-inventory-v0"`.
2. A new required `"capabilities_schema"` field, always
   `"scene-capabilities-v1"` — names which frozen `docs/SCENE_CAPABILITIES.md`
   taxonomy version the record's capability IDs were drawn from, independent
   of the record's own wire schema version.
3. A new required, nullable `"backend"` field (`null` or a JSON object) —
   reserved for renderer backend/GPU/driver identity (plan §5.3: "GPU/driver,
   compiler"); `null` until a producer populates it (kwe-scene-inspector, a
   pure classification/hash tool, has no backend of its own and always emits
   `null`).

Every other field, and its meaning, is unchanged from v0.

### v0 → v1 field mapping

| v0 (`scene-feature-inventory-v0`) | v1 (`scene-inspection-v1`) | Change |
|---|---|---|
| `schema` | `schema` | Value changes to `"scene-inspection-v1"` |
| — | `capabilities_schema` | New, always `"scene-capabilities-v1"` |
| `content` | `content` | Unchanged shape |
| `inspector` | `inspector` | Unchanged shape |
| `outcome` | `outcome` | Unchanged |
| `reason` | `reason` | Unchanged |
| `required` | `required` | Unchanged |
| `detected` | `detected` | Unchanged |
| `unknown` | `unknown` | Unchanged shape |
| `bounds` | `bounds` | Unchanged shape |
| — | `backend` | New, `null` or an object |
| `digest` | `digest` | Same computation rule, now over the v1 record (see below) |

### Full field list (as `validate_inspection` checks it)

```json
{
  "schema": "scene-inspection-v1",
  "capabilities_schema": "scene-capabilities-v1",
  "content": { "hash": "sha256:...", "source_bytes": 0, "kind": "pkg|json-dir" },
  "inspector": { "build": "dev", "abi": 0 },
  "outcome": "inventoried | unknown | incompatible",
  "reason": "ok | timeout | oversize | parse-error | ...stable reason codes",
  "required": ["scene.layer.image", "...sorted, deduplicated capability IDs"],
  "detected": [
    { "capability": "scene.effects", "count": 0,
      "objects": ["...first N stable logical IDs, sorted"], "truncated": false }
  ],
  "unknown": {
    "keys": 0, "types": 0, "objects": 0,
    "samples": ["...first N key paths, sorted"], "truncated": false
  },
  "bounds": { "wall_ms": 0, "peak_bytes": 0, "limits_hit": ["...reason codes"] },
  "backend": null,
  "digest": "..."
}
```

`validate_inspection` checks, top to bottom: `schema` equals
`SCENE_INSPECTION_SCHEMA`; `capabilities_schema` equals
`SCENE_CAPABILITIES_SCHEMA`; `content` is an object with `hash` (string),
`source_bytes` (number), `kind` (string); `inspector` is an object with
`build` (string), `abi` (number); `outcome` and `reason` are strings;
`required` and `detected` are arrays (element shape is not itself validated
by this function — that is SR-1c's or the consumer's job once a
capability/record-level policy exists); `unknown` is an object with numeric
`keys`/`types`/`objects`, an array `samples`, and a boolean `truncated`;
`bounds` is an object with numeric `wall_ms` and an array `limits_hit`
(`peak_bytes` is not separately required by this check); `backend` is
`null` or an object; `digest` is a string. A missing field and a
present-but-wrong-type field are always distinguished (`MissingField(path)`
vs. `WrongType(path)`, where `path` is the dotted field path, e.g.
`"content.source_bytes"`).

### Digest rule

The digest is the hex-encoded SHA-256 of the record serialized with its own
`"digest"` field set to `""` — byte-for-byte the same rule
`kwe-scene-inspector`'s `build_record` already uses
(`crates/kwe-scene-inspector/src/main.rs`):

```
digest = hex(sha256(serde_json::to_vec(record_with_digest_field_set_to_empty_string)))
```

This is deterministic only because `serde_json::Value`'s object
representation is a `BTreeMap` in this workspace, so `serde_json::to_vec`
always emits object keys in sorted order regardless of the order they were
inserted in. This rule requires the `preserve_order` `serde_json` feature to
stay off across the whole workspace (it is off today — no crate enables
it); turning it on anywhere in the dependency graph would make key order,
and therefore the digest, insertion-order dependent instead of a pure
function of the record's content, silently breaking every already-computed
digest's verifiability. `kwe-report-protocol`'s own crate doc carries the
same warning next to `validate_inspection`.

`validate_inspection` does not itself enforce the 64 KiB payload cap — it
assumes its caller already read the payload through a capped path
(`FrameReader`, or SR-1c's daemon-side frame handling), and degrades
gracefully rather than unsoundly on an uncapped buffer regardless
(`serde_json::from_slice` parses or errors on any input size; it never
panics).
