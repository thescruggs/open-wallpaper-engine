# Scene format v1 and SceneScript API

Status: **implemented (M3a)** for the items marked below, with the
**scene.pkg archive reader (M3b)** added for the items marked M3b;
everything else in the table is planned and reserved, not implemented. This
document describes what the worker (`kwe-scene-renderer`, the daemon's
`scene` kind) accepts and what script surface it runs. The scene entry
format is the foundation slice of the original SceneScript engine per ADR
0001.

## Provenance

The scene.json parser, the QuickJS engine wrapper, and the Vulkan
compositor are an original implementation: the scene format and script API
are inspired by the behavior of open-wallpaper-engine and
linux-wallpaperengine (and through them, the original wallpaper engine
scene format), consulted **as behavior references only** — for the shape
of `scene.json` and the script entry points `init` / `update` / `resized`
— through M3g.

**S1 changes this for the TEXV texture container and model/material
resolution specifically.** The project relicensed to GPL-3.0-or-later
(2026-08-22, docs/PROVENANCE.md) to permit adapting GPL-3.0 code from
`Almamu/linux-wallpaperengine`, and the TEXV decoder
(`crates/kwe-scene-renderer/src/texv.rs`) and model/material resolver
(`crates/kwe-core/src/scenemodel.rs`) do exactly that: they are adapted
from that project's `TextureParser.cpp`/`Texture.h`,
`ModelParser.cpp`/`MaterialParser.cpp`/`Material.h`, and
`AssetLocator.cpp`, each function carrying a `Borrowed-From:` comment with
the upstream path, line range, and commit (`b016d7d1`) per
docs/PROVENANCE.md. See THIRD_PARTY.yml for the linked upstream commit,
the license review, and the `texture2ddecoder` crate this decode also
depends on. Every other section of this document (scene.json, image
layers, blend modes, text, particles, scene.pkg, script API) remains the
original implementation described above.

## scene.json

A UTF-8 JSON file, at most **16 MiB** (`MAX_SCENE_JSON_BYTES`). The root
must be an object. Parse failures — unreadable file, invalid JSON, wrong
shape, out-of-range values, or a `script` reference that is missing,
non-string, escapes the content root, is not a `.js` file, or exceeds the
2 MiB cap — are backend rejections: a bounded stderr diagnostic
(`event=renderer.scene.backend_reject kind=... detail=...`) and **exit 73**
before the canary, so the supervisor records `exit_code_73` and rolls back.

```json
{
  "general": {
    "clearcolor": [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 1.0],
    "resolution": [1920, 1080],
    "fps": 30,
    "script": "script.js"
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning in M3a |
|---|---|---|---|
| `general` | object (optional) | `{}` | Scene-wide settings. Must be an object when present. |
| `general.clearcolor` | `[r, g, b, a]` of finite floats in `0.0..=1.0`, exactly 4 entries, **or** the string form `"r g b"` (three space-separated finite floats in `0.0..=1.0`, alpha implied `1.0`) | `[0, 0, 0, 1]` | The color the worker clears every frame — unless the script writes `Engine.clearcolor`, which is read back after every `update()`. The string form is what Wallpaper Engine actually writes: **59 of 60** corpus scene.json entries use it (e.g. `"clearcolor": "0.7 0.7 0.7"`, one with five-digit precision); the property-wrapped object form `{"user": ..., "value": ...}` (1 of 60) stays rejected until user properties arrive in M3c+. |
| `general.resolution` | `[w, h]` of integers in `1..=8192`, exactly 2 entries (optional) | none | Parsed and validated, but **non-binding in M3a**: the worker always renders at the daemon-requested `--width`/`--height`. A mismatch is logged once (`event=renderer.scene.resolution scene=... requested=...`), not an error. S7: when absent, real Wallpaper Engine's `general.orthogonalprojection {"width","height"}` is accepted as the same value (lenient — a malformed projection just leaves this field `None`, never a reject). |
| `general.fps` | finite float in `(0.0, 240.0]` (optional) | none | Same: parsed and validated, non-binding hint; a mismatch is logged (`event=renderer.scene.fps`), not an error. The pacing always comes from the daemon's `--fps`. |
| `general.script` | string (optional) | none | A path **relative to the scene.json's directory** (file scenes) or **an entry path inside the package** (pkg scenes, M3b). File scenes: resolved against the canonicalized content root so symlinks cannot escape it; must end in `.js` (a `.pkg` reference is rejected — the archive itself is only consumable through the M3b reader), must exist, be a regular file, and be at most **2 MiB** (`MAX_SCRIPT_BYTES`). Pkg scenes: see "scene.pkg" below. |

Anything else in `general` or at the root is ignored (future slices:
effects, properties — image layers are M3c). Unknown top-level structure
never fails the parse.

## Image layers (M3c)

`objects` is an array of layer objects drawn in **scene.json order** — the
compositor's draw order: the layer listed last draws on top, src-over
blending by default with per-layer blend modes (M3d). An object is an image layer exactly when
it carries an `image` field; everything else (particles, audio, text —
M3d+) is ignored. A reference ending in `.json` is a model instance under
the WE solid-model architecture — **620 of the 685 corpus image
references point at model `.json` files, the other 65 carry a null image
value; none point at a real texture** — so no corpus wallpaper yet
exercises the decoded-texture path. Model references are skipped BEFORE
any validation (a malformed model layer can never reject the scene),
without a diagnostic, and are not counted toward the layer cap, until
models arrive (M3h). At most **256 image layers** (`MAX_LAYERS`); a scene
with 257 is a Shape rejection (exit 73, "over the 256 layer cap").

```json
{
  "general": {"clearcolor": [0, 0, 0, 1], "resolution": [160, 90], "fps": 30},
  "objects": [
    {"name": "bg", "image": "textures/red.png",
     "origin": [80, 45], "size": [160, 90], "alpha": 1.0, "visible": true},
    {"name": "mark", "image": "textures/blue.png",
     "origin": [140, 79], "size": [40, 22]}
  ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning in M3c |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string, **required** | — | the layer's name for `Scene.getLayer(name)`; a missing or non-string name rejects the layer entry |
| `image` | string | none | the image reference (see "Image sources" below); a non-string value makes the object inert (skipped, not rejected) |
| `origin` | `[x, y]` (2 or 3 entries) | `[0, 0]` | the layer's **center**, in ABSOLUTE scene-pixel units, top-left origin, +y down — matching upstream's own convention (`CImage.cpp`'s `origin.x - scaledSize.x/2` etc. builds a layer's corners directly from this absolute value; a full-screen layer's `origin` is `[declared resolution / 2, declared resolution / 2]`, e.g. `[80, 45]` above for a 160x90 scene, NOT `[0, 0]`). The compositor recenters this absolute value onto the visible rectangle's own centre before the NDC divide (S6 fix, `vulkan::LayerRenderer::set_world_extent`/`recenter`, `crates/kwe-scene-renderer/src/vulkan.rs`); the default `[0, 0]` therefore places an object at the scene's own TOP-LEFT corner when its `origin` is omitted, not at the frame centre. z is unused by 2D rendering |
| `angles` | `[rx, ry, rz]` (2 or 3 entries) | `[0, 0, 0]` | **radians in the file**, converted to degrees at parse (the script API speaks degrees); corpus-verified: exact π, none at 90/180 |
| `scale` | `[sx, sy]` (2 or 3 entries) | `[1, 1]` | relative scale about the origin; negative values mirror |
| `size` | `[w, h]` (exactly 2 entries) | `[0, 0]` | the size in scene units the texture is drawn at; `[0, 0]` (absent) takes the decoded texture's own dimensions at load |
| `alpha` | float in `0.0..=1.0` | `1.0` | straight layer alpha; out-of-range or non-finite rejects the scene (like clearcolor) |
| `visible` | boolean | `true` | an invisible layer draws nothing |
| `colorBlendMode` | integer (alias `blendMode`) | `0` | the corpus key; a per-layer blend mode from the researched table in "Blend modes and color effects (M3d)" below. Corpus (re-scan): 432 of 685 image-bearing objects carry it — 410×0, 6×11, 6×30, 4×6, 2×24, 1×1, 1×7, 1×9, 1×12 (sums to 432) — the rest omit it (normal). A non-numeric value is tolerated (normal), never a rejection; an undecodable but numeric value clamps to normal with a bounded one-time diagnostic |
| `brightness` | float or numeric string | `1.0` | multiplies the sampled RGB before blending (see M3d); the default 1.0 is the identity (WE-verified), the clamp range 0..=10 is a design decision; out-of-range and non-finite values clamp, never a rejection; a non-numeric type is a Shape rejection |
| `tint` | `[r, g, b]` or `[r, g, b, a]` of floats in `0.0..=1.0` (alias `color` — the WE file key, vec3 or vec4; `tint` takes precedence when both are present) | `[1, 1, 1, 1]` | multiplied onto the sampled RGBA before blending (see M3d); a 3-component value implies alpha 1; per-component clamped (non-finite → 1.0), never a rejection |

Property-wrapped values (`{"user": ..., "value": ...}` — how the editor
serializes user-bindable fields; corpus re-scan: **70% (315/447) of image
layers carrying `alpha` and 49% (276/568) of those carrying `visible`**
are wrapped) are unwrapped to their initial `value`; the wrapper's user
binding is M3j, and a wrapped scalar without a `value` rejects like any
malformed scalar.

The transform model: a layer is a rectangle of `size` scene units centered
on `origin`, drawn as two fan-ordered triangles (one unit quad, 6
vertices of pos+uv — `TRIANGLE_LIST` primitives (v0,v1,v2) and (v0,v2,v3)
tile the full quad). Per layer:
`world = R(θz)·diag(scale·size)·pos + origin` for `pos ∈ [-0.5, 0.5]²` —
rotation and scale happen about the origin, in that order; the z-angle
rotates 2D layers (radians in the file, degrees in the API). The
compositor pushes 64 bytes per layer (M3d grew the block from 48 to 64):
m0 = (a, c, tx, 0), m1 = (b, d, ty, alpha·tint.a), viewport = (w, h, 0, 0),
effects = (brightness, tint.r, tint.g, tint.b). The first 48 bytes are
byte-identical to the M3c layout, so the vertex shader reads the same
offsets; `world = mat2(m0.xy, m1.xy)·pos + (m0.z, m1.z)`, and the fragment
shader multiplies the texture's alpha by m1.w (the layer alpha folded with
the tint alpha host-side) and the sampled RGB by the effects vector,
**before** blending. `(m0.z, m1.z)` is NOT `origin` verbatim: it is
`origin` minus the scene's own centre (S6 fix, `vulkan::recenter`), so
that this `world` space's `(0,0)` lands on the visible rectangle's centre
— matching `viewport`, which is the F1 visible world extent
(`world_extent`, `crates/kwe-scene-renderer/src/main.rs`), not the raw
canvas size, whenever the declared `resolution` and canvas aspect ratio
differ.

Blending is src-over by default (the Normal variant): color
ONE / ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA, alpha ONE / ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA — the fragment
shader outputs straight color, so the attachment stores the straight
composite and the readback's premultiplication is applied exactly once, at
the protocol boundary (see Output); the source alpha is never scaled by
itself (a 191/255 layer over an opaque destination stays 191/255, not
143/255, and a translucent layer is not darkened by a second alpha
multiply). Blend oracle, byte-exact on both drivers: opaque texel
(64,103,142,255) at layer alpha 191/255 over a zero clear is delivered as
premultiplied BGRA (106,77,48,191). A non-default `colorBlendMode` selects
one of the fixed-function variants in "Blend modes and color effects
(M3d)" below. The model math is byte-tested: identity exact, quarter-turn
axis mapping, corner positions for known inputs.

## Blend modes and color effects (M3d)

Per-layer color blending in the Wallpaper Engine sense: a `colorBlendMode`
enum rendered through fixed-function Vulkan blending, two color-effect
fields, and a fixed ordering — **the effects apply to the sampled texel in
the fragment shader; the blend mode combines the result with the frame in
the pipeline's blend state** (the shader never blends; the blend state
never scales colors).

### The researched colorBlendMode table

WE serializes `colorBlendMode` as an integer. The editor dropdown exposes
exactly {Normal, Multiply, Add, Screen, Subtract} (wpdoc UI strings; Steam
patch note: "standard Photoshop blend modes"; rendered by the proprietary
`ApplyBlending` shader, type `imageblending`), which pins the five-mode
FAMILY — it says nothing about the integers behind them. No public WE
shader source exists, so the value→name mapping below is a corpus-histogram
HYPOTHESIS: 0 dominates (410 of 432 occurrences) and is the editor's
default for new objects (verified); 1/6/7/9 are assigned to the remaining
four dropdown names as the best fit — the histogram's non-zero values that
round out the dropdown family (the five decoded values cover 17 of the 22
non-zero occurrences). The other 15 occurrences — 11, 30, 24, 12 — sit
OUTSIDE the dropdown family, so the original evidently tolerates integers
its own editor cannot produce (ours clamp to Normal with a diagnostic).
The formulas below are the oracle ground truth, byte-validated on the
llvmpipe lane.

Evidence grades: **verified** = a public source pins the value (0 only);
**decoded** = the best-fit corpus-histogram hypothesis, consistent with
the dropdown family but not independently confirmable; **undecoded** = no
credible hypothesis and not expressible in fixed-function Vulkan blending
(kept for corpus tolerance).

| Value | Name | Implemented? | Vulkan blend state (color / alpha) | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Normal | yes | (ONE, ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA) / (ONE, ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA), ADD | verified — the corpus-dominant value, the editor default |
| 1 | Multiply | yes | (DST_COLOR, ZERO) / (ONE, ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA), ADD | decoded |
| 6 | Add | yes | (ONE, ONE) / (ONE, ONE), ADD | decoded |
| 7 | Screen | yes | (ONE_MINUS_DST_COLOR, ONE) / (ONE, ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA), ADD | decoded |
| 9 | Subtract | yes | (ONE, ONE) REVERSE_SUBTRACT / (ONE, ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA), ADD | decoded |
| 11, 12, 24, 30 | — | **no** | clamped to Normal + one bounded diagnostic per scene (`event=renderer.scene.blend_mode_clamped layer=... mode=...`) | undecoded — outside the dropdown family, not fixed-function |
| any other | — | no | silently Normal (unknown values tolerated, like the original evidently tolerates 11/30/24/12) | — |

Semantics (the formulas the oracles hand-compute; `t` = texel,
`b` = background, per channel in 0..255):
- **Normal** = src-over: `t·a + b·(1−a)`.
- **Multiply** = `t·b / 255`.
- **Add** = `min(255, t + b)`.
- **Screen** = `255 − (255−t)(255−b) / 255` = `t·(1−b) + b`.
- **Subtract** = `max(0, b − t)` — the background minus the texel: WE's
  "Photoshop blend modes" family and the Vulkan REVERSE_SUBTRACT algebra
  (dst − src) agree; a reversed direction would fail the oracle.
- **Alpha policy** (deliberate, pinned by oracles): the mode acts on the
  COLOR; the alpha channel always composites src-over (ONE,
  ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA) — the layer's own opacity still matters under every
  mode — except **Add**, whose semantic is additive on both channels
  (ONE, ONE). This fixes the review finding that Multiply's original
  (ZERO, ONE) discarded the layer's alpha entirely (a translucent multiply
  over a transparent backdrop vanished; over an opaque one the delivered
  alpha ignored the layer's opacity): the translucent-multiply oracle
  (11,20,20,192) pins the src-over alpha byte-exact.

The Screen factors were corrected during oracle validation: the first
draft used (ONE, ONE_MINUS_DST_COLOR), which computes `t + b·(1−b)` — not
the screen formula — and the device byte oracle caught the mismatch
([165,151,125] produced vs [154,141,140] hand-computed). The shipped
(ONE_MINUS_DST_COLOR, ONE) computes `t·(1−b) + b`, the screen formula.

The renderer prebuilds one pipeline variant per implemented mode (five;
N ≤ 16) sharing the layout, and binds the layer's variant per draw. The
`Scene.getLayer` proxy's read/write `blendMode` maps through this table:
writing 0/1/6/7/9 selects the mode; writing 11/12/24/30 clamps to Normal
with the same bounded diagnostic; any other value clamps silently.

### brightness and tint

| Field | File key | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `brightness` | `brightness` | `1.0` | multiplies the sampled RGB. The default 1.0 is the identity — a WE-verified fact (the OWE WPImageObject default); the clamp range `0.0..=10.0` is a design decision (dimming to black, up to a 10x boost), not a documented WE bound. Out-of-range values clamp, non-finite → 1.0 |
| `tint` | `tint` (alias `color` — the WE file key, vec3 or vec4; `tint` wins when both are present) | `[1,1,1,1]` | multiplies the sampled RGBA; per-component clamped to `0.0..=1.0`, non-finite → 1.0; a vec3 implies alpha 1.0 |

Both parse property-wrapped (the corpus editor form) and both clamp
out-of-range VALUES instead of rejecting — a too-bright effect darkens or
boosts a layer, never fails the scene. Wrong-TYPED values do reject like
alpha, with one corpus-honest exception: `brightness` accepts a JSON
number or a numeric string (the corpus editor serializes scalars as
strings); `tint` components must be numbers inside an array or
space-separated string. The tint alpha is folded into the pushed `m1.w`
host-side, so the shader's single multiply `a · layer_alpha · tint.a`
covers both.

Byte-exact oracle (llvmpipe, `scripts/smoke-scene.sh`): fullscreen texel
(64,103,142) over opaque clear (102,64,26) at the frame center (80,45) —
normal (142,103,64,255); multiply (14,26,26,255); add (168,167,166,255);
screen (154,141,140,255); subtract (0,0,38,255); effects (brightness 2.0,
tint (1, 0.4, 0.5)) (142,82,128,255); and add at layer alpha 0.5 over a
transparent clear pins the single premultiplication: the attachment stores
the straight composite (64,103,142,128) — alpha 0.5·255 = 127.5 rounds to
128 — and the readback premultiplies exactly once (71,52,32,128). The
translucent-multiply pin: multiply at layer alpha 0.5 over a 0.5-alpha
clear — the hard multiply stores (14,26,26) and the src-over alpha
0.5 + (128/255)·0.5 = 191.5 rounds to 192 — delivered (11,20,20,192): the
layer's own opacity survives, and the readback premultiplies exactly once.

## Text layers (M3e)

Text is a WE scene object family on par with images (the WE `Text`
objects; the OWE reference renders them through a dynamic glyph atlas of
quads — the architecture mirrored here). **Corpus reality**: the corpus
carries zero textures and zero known text layers — no real wallpaper
exercises text — so the implementation is validated with synthetic
fixtures (the `scripts/smoke-scene.sh` M3e lanes) and unit tests over
synthetic font directories via `--font-dir` / `KWE_FONT_DIRS`, never with
byte-pinned real-content renders.

### Researched reference facts

- `pointsize` is the WE file key for the font size, in points; **`fontsize`
  is not a WE key** (tolerated as an unknown key, never parsed). OWE's
  `TextPointSizeToPx` multiplies by `kPointsizeToPx = 4.0` and clamps to
  1..=1024 px. We multiply by the same 4.0 and clamp to **4..=512 px**
  (documented deviation: `MIN_FONT_PX`/`MAX_FONT_PX` — stricter bounds keep
  a single glyph comfortably inside the atlas).
- Alignment defaults to **center/center** in the original (OWE resolves
  `horizontalalign` → `alignment` → center); our parse mirrors the
  defaults.
- WE system fonts are addressed as `systemfont_<Family>` in scenes; the
  prefix is stripped before resolution.
- `text` and `font` are property-wrapped in the corpus editor form
  (`{user, value}`).
- WE text objects carry a `color` (vec3 or vec4), `alpha` and `brightness`
  like image objects; the color tints the glyphs.
- `font` accepts a family name, a `systemfont_` alias, or a path
  (absolute, or a basename matched against the scanned files).

### Font resolution order

One resolver per worker, cached per normalized family (alphanumerics
lowercased). Font sources: explicit `--font-dir` / `KWE_FONT_DIRS`
entries first, then `/usr/share/fonts`, `/usr/local/share/fonts`,
`~/.local/share/fonts`, `~/.fonts` — bounded (16 dirs, depth 4, 4096
files per dir, 16384 resolved files, 64 MiB per file) and sorted for
determinism. Resolution:

1. **Exact** — among basename candidates, the first whose name-table
   family matches. Verified via the vendored stb_truetype name records
   (decoded by the C shim: Windows/Unicode records are UTF-16BE, Mac
   records single-byte), bounded to 32 opens (`MAX_FAMILY_VERIFY`).

stb_truetype does no range checking of its own, so every candidate file
is **sfnt pre-flight validated by the shim before any stb call**: the
offset table (tag, table count) and each table record's `offset+length`
must lie inside the file (u64 math), ttc collection offsets must
resolve inside the buffer, and where cheap (`maxp`/`loca`/`glyf`) the
glyph ranges are checked before outline rasterization — hostile or
truncated fonts are rejected at open (`Font::open` → None), never
parsed. (Because the directory collection stops at a per-directory cap
before opening anything, a pathological font directory cannot force a
huge allocation either.)
2. **Basename** — the first unverified basename-prefix candidate in
   sorted order (WE-style basename matching; may be a CJK or condensed
   variant).
3. **Fallback chain** — ["Noto Sans", "DejaVu Sans", "Liberation Sans",
   "FreeSans"], each through steps 1–2; the resolution is reported as a
   fallback so the load-time diagnostic records the order.
4. **Any** — the first file that parses, in scan order.
5. **None** — the layer renders nothing; one bounded diagnostic per layer
   (`event=renderer.scene.text_font_none layer=... requested=...`).

A `font` written as a path resolves directly when it exists, else by
basename against the scanned files. Daemon-spawned workers carry fixed
args, so daemon lanes resolve real system fonts only; the synthetic-font
lanes (`--font-dir`, unit tests) drive the order above end-to-end.

### Implemented subset (M3e)

- **scene.json keys**: `text` (required to classify the object as a text
  layer; an object with `image` is an image layer — a `.json` image ref
  stays a model, M3h — and one with `text` *and* `image` is an image
  layer with the text counted), `font`, `pointsize`, `horizontalalign` /
  `verticalalign` (with `alignment` accepted for the horizontal, like the
  OWE chain), `color` (RGB/RGBA, property-wrapped or plain). Missing or
  blank `text` renders nothing. A scene-written `size` on a text layer is
  **ignored** (counted, one-time diagnostic): text renders at its
  automatic layout size with `size` pinned to (1,1), so layout pixels map
  1:1 to scene units; resizing happens through `scale` like every other
  layer.
- **Common properties** (origin, angles, scale, alpha, visible,
  blendMode, brightness, tint) inherit the M3c/M3d path unchanged,
  including the M3d alpha policy: the text color's alpha is folded into
  the layer alpha (`m1.w`) exactly like a tint.
- **Rendering**: one 2048×2048 RGBA8 glyph atlas per text layer
  (16 MiB), shelf-packed, white glyphs (RGB=255, coverage in alpha) with
  the text color riding the draw's tint slot — **zero shader changes**:
  the M3d fragment shader multiplies the sampled RGB by the tint and the
  alpha by the layer alpha, so glyph interiors land exactly in the text
  color and antialiased edges blend toward the background. Glyph quads
  span the unpadded metric box while their UVs are inset by the 1 px
  atlas pad, so glyph texels map 1:1 onto the quad. An overflow
  triggers a clear+repack, rate-limited to 2/s
  (`event=renderer.scene.text_atlas_rebuild_rate_limited`); font and
  pointsize changes run the same clear+repack **through the same
  budget** — a change that lands inside the 2/s window applies on the
  next sync with the previous atlas and geometry kept consistent
  meanwhile, so a 60 fps pointsize toggle cannot force a full repack
  per frame (only the initial load bypasses the budget); a glyph
  larger than 520 px is skipped
  (`event=renderer.scene.text_glyph_too_large`). Each text layer draws as
  one `DrawKind::Text` — `vertex_count` vertices (6 per glyph quad), one
  TRIANGLE_LIST draw — through a per-layer host-visible vertex buffer
  (created or grown, max 393 216 bytes). The atlas uploads through the
  existing image upload path and is **counted in the shared 256 MiB
  texture budget** at upload (16 MiB per layer; 16 text layers = the
  cap, first-come-first-served with image textures; one bounded
  `text_atlas_budget_skip` when the budget is already exhausted, with a
  byte refund if the upload fails); dirty state is synced before the
  initial render and each NewFrame, regenerating geometry only on text /
  alignment / font-size change.
- **JS surface** (`Scene.getLayer` on a text layer): read/write `text`
  (string; a write truncates to 4096 chars with
  `event=renderer.scene.text_truncated` and rebuilds the geometry),
  `pointsize` (clamped 4..=512 px; non-finite/≤0 → the default 12 pt →
  48 px), `horizontalAlign` / `verticalAlign` (0/1/2 = left|top /
  center / right|bottom, clamped), `color` (read/write `{r,g,b,a}`
  0..=1 per component — the scene.json color, writable through
  `layer.color.r = x` style sub-property writes, clamped per component
  like every other write path and tinting the glyphs; alpha folds into
  the layer alpha), plus all common layer properties. Text-only
  properties are only defined on text layers: on image layers they read
  `undefined` and writes reach no renderer state — never shared state.
- **Diagnostics** (one per layer, bounded): `text_font_fallback`,
  `text_font_none`, `text_truncated`, `text_atlas_rebuild_rate_limited`
  and `text_glyph_too_large` (each printed once per layer), and
  `text_atlas_budget_skip` (once per worker when the shared texture
  budget is exhausted at upload time).

### Bounds

| Bound | Value | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| text layers per scene | 16 (`MAX_TEXT_LAYERS`) | further text objects are skipped (counted), never a rejection |
| text length | 4096 chars (`MAX_TEXT_CHARS`) | script writes truncate; scene.json longer strings truncate with the same diagnostic |
| font size | 4..=512 px (`MIN_FONT_PX`..`MAX_FONT_PX`), default 12 pt × 4 = 48 px | out-of-range and non-finite clamp to the default at the parse |
| point→px | × 4.0 (`POINT_TO_PX`, the researched WE multiplier) | rounded, then clamped |
| atlas | 2048² RGBA8 per layer, shelf-packed; each 16 MiB counts in the shared 256 MiB texture budget (first-come-first-served with image textures) | clear+repack rate-limited to 2/s — overflow and font/pointsize changes alike; one bounded `text_atlas_budget_skip` when the shared budget is exhausted |
| glyph bitmap | ≤ 520×520 px | larger glyphs are skipped per layer, never fatal |
| font file | 64 MiB | over-budget files are skipped by the resolver |
| font scan | 16 dirs, depth 4, 4096 files/dir, 16384 files | deterministic (sorted); directory entries are collected with an early stop at the per-dir cap, before any file is opened |
| family verify | 32 opens (`MAX_FAMILY_VERIFY`) | the Exact step never walks the whole corpus; past it, the Basename step returns the first candidate **unverified** — a family served by many files (CJK or condensed variants) can win over the regular face when the regular face sorts late |
| sfnt pre-flight | offset table, table records, ttc offsets, and (where cheap) maxp/loca/glyf ranges validated in the shim before any stb call | hostile or truncated fonts are rejected at open (`Font::open` → None), never parsed |
| atlas rebuild budget | 2/s (`ATLAS_REBUILDS_PER_SECOND`), 1 s window | overflow and font/pointsize changes all ride the budget; the initial load is the only unbounded path |

## Particle systems (M3f)

Particle systems are a WE scene object family on par with images and
text (the OWE reference renders emitters as point-quad instanced draws
with per-particle color/size interpolation over life; the architecture
mirrored here, with the instancing flattened into one batched vertex
buffer per system). M3f implements the **flat emitter model**: every
property is a scene.json key or a script-visible scalar, the simulation
advances on a fixed 1/60 s timestep, and each system draws through a
per-mode blend pipeline — the M3d semantics unchanged. **Corpus
reality**: the corpus carries zero particle systems (and zero textures —
an emitter needs one), so the implementation is validated with synthetic
fixtures (the `scripts/smoke-scene.sh` M3f lanes) and unit tests, never
with byte-pinned real-content renders.

### Researched reference facts

- WE emitters are configured in the file through a nested `particle`
  object; `maxcount` is the WE key for the live-particle cap, default
  **100** (we default to 1000 and clamp 1..=4096 — documented deviation:
  a 100 default starves every smoke fixture and hides over-spawn bugs).
- WE emitters carry **no `direction`/`spread` fields**: launch velocity
  comes from the velocity-random initializer (`Initializer.VELOCITY`),
  which is not file-configurable. The flat `direction` (radians from +x,
  y down) + `spread` (0..=2π cone) model is the M3f extension the
  deterministic smoke oracles need (documented deviation).
- The WE script surface is `IParticleSystem` (object accessors, plus
  `play()` = resume emission, `pause()` = emission off with live
  particles still simulating, `stop()` = clear immediately, `isPlaying()`
  = emitting or alive, `emitParticles(count)`, default count 1, works
  while stopped) and `IParticleSystemInstance` with the factors
  `count`, `speed`, `lifetime`, `size`, `alpha`, `rate`, `colorn` (the
  intentional WE spelling), each defaulting to 1.0; non-finite values
  clamp to 1.0 and the range clamps to [0, 1e6] (alpha/colorn to [0, 1]).
- WE emitter texture field is `material` (the brief's `texture` wins when
  both are present), resolved through the M3c image-source chain
  including the package table.
- WE blend modes map 0/1/6/7/9 = Normal/Multiply/Add/Screen/Subtract
  (the M3d table); `blendMode` and `colorBlendMode` are both accepted.
- WE randomness is per-frame and non-deterministic; M3f replaces it with
  one splitmix64 stream per system, seeded by the system index — a
  documented deviation. The stream itself is deterministic (the same
  spawn sequence repeats in the same order), BUT the fixed-step schedule
  derives from wall-clock dt, so the scene's live population depends on
  real time, not on the scene alone. Spread-0 systems never touch the
  stream at all (their trajectories are exact — what the range oracles
  rely on).

### scene.json keys (the `particle` object)

All keys in the table below live **inside** the `"particle"` dict
(`objects[i].particle.*`) except the shared-props row (`blendMode`,
`alpha`, `brightness`, `visible`), which sit on the object **beside**
`particle` like every WE object (`objects[i].blendMode` — the M3c/M3d
common path, corpus: `colorBlendMode` on image objects; `material` is
inside the dict per the WE texture field).

Missing keys take the defaults; scalar fields clamp (out-of-range →
clamp bound, non-finite → default); vector fields (`gravity`,
`colorStart`, `colorEnd`) reject non-vector shapes like every WE vector.
`speedMin`/`speedMax` win over a bare `speed`; a missing `speedMax`
falls back to the resolved minimum, and a reversed pair normalizes
(min ≤ max) — the runtime picks launch speeds uniformly in [min, max].

| Key | Range | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `spawnRate` | 0..=4096 /s | 10 | integer or numeric string |
| `life` | 0.1..=60 s | 1.0 | |
| `speed` / `speedMin` / `speedMax` | 0..=1e6 px/s | 0 | the pair supersedes `speed`; reversed pairs normalize |
| `direction` | ±1e6 | 0 | radians from +x, y down (M3f extension, see research notes); clamped in f64 BEFORE the f32 cast — a huge finite value like 1e300 must never overflow to f32::INFINITY (sin/cos of infinity is NaN, permanently poisoning the system) |
| `spread` | 0..=2π | 0 | all particles take the exact direction at 0 |
| `gravity` | ±1e6 px/s², 1..=3 components | [0, 0] | `[g]` → `[0, g]` (y down); extra components dropped |
| `sizeStart` / `sizeEnd` | 1..=512 px | 8 | interpolated over life |
| `colorStart` / `colorEnd` | RGBA 0..=1 each | white | vec3 implies alpha 1; interpolated over life |
| `alphaStart` / `alphaEnd` | 0..=1 | 1 → 0 | particles fade out by default |
| `maxCount` | 1..=4096 | 1000 | the WE key; integer or numeric string (floats reject like every integer key); excess spawns **drop**, never evict live particles (documented deviation from WE's 100) |
| `texture` / `material` | M3c image source | none | `texture` wins when both present; a non-string is None — the system registers and simulates but draws nothing |
| `blendMode` / `colorBlendMode` | M3d enum | Normal | pre-clamp; the runtime clamps to the implemented set like every layer |
| `alpha` / `brightness` / `visible` | M3c/M3d common | 1 / 1 / true | drawn effects; read-only through the script surface in M3f (the instance factors are the script knobs) |

Shared properties (`origin`, `angles`, `scale`, `alpha`, `visible`,
`blendMode`, `brightness`, `tint`) parse through the M3c/M3d path, but
`angles`/`scale` are **not applied** in M3f — particle systems render
world-space with `origin` only (documented deviation; the system
transform is planned).

### Simulation model

One `ParticleSystemState` per registered system, stepped every frame
with the frame's dt (`sync_particles`; also seeded with one pacing
interval at load so the first published frame already shows particles):

1. **accumulate** — `rate`-scaled dt (the WE simulation-rate factor),
   capped at 1.0 s (60 steps) per frame, `MAX_FRAME_DT` 1.0 s wall per
   frame; a stalled frame never unstretches.
2. **spawn** — only while emitting or a burst is pending (`play()` /
   `pause()` / `stop()` / `emitParticles(count)`, WE semantics); the
   per-step due count is `spawnRate × count × h`, floored, excess
   **dropped** (never evicted, one bounded
   `event=renderer.scene.particles_capped` per system), accumulator
   capped at 65536.
3. **integrate** — explicit Euler: `v += g·h; x += v·h; age += h`.
4. **retain** — particles with `age ≥ life` die (step 3's birth step
   order makes a particle born at step s sit at `(n−s+1) × speed × h`
   after n steps).

Size, color and alpha interpolate over normalized age
(`age / life`, clamped), so a `sizeStart 8, sizeEnd 4, alphaStart 1,
alphaEnd 0` particle shrinks and fades linearly. Determinism: every op
is f32 fixed-step; spread-0 trajectories are exact (no RNG), spread
systems use the per-system splitmix64 stream seeded by system index.

### Rendering

Each system owns one host-visible vertex buffer — **create-or-grow**:
uploaded on the first draw, grown when the vertex count exceeds the
current capacity, never shrunk. The buffer CONTENTS are rebuilt AND
re-uploaded every frame a fixed step ran (that is how often the live
particles can have changed — the sim's step order; a frame without a
step leaves the buffer untouched). The rebuild writes 6 vertices per
particle (an axis-aligned quad expanded around the center,
`tr/tl/bl/br` UVs covering the full texture), 40-byte stride with
per-particle color and size folded into the vertex attributes
(`shaders/particle.vert` / `particle.frag` — the M3f shader pair), via
one scratch Vec the worker reuses across systems and frames (no
per-frame allocation churn). Blend modes reuse the M3d per-mode pipeline
variants (≤ 16 pipelines, one per mode); the texture rides slot
`MAX_LAYERS + system_index` (272 slots total). A missing, over-budget or
undecodable material skips the system's draw at load (`particle_skip`,
never fatal — the system still simulates), and a vertex-upload failure
is contained the same way.

### Bounds

| Bound | Value | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| particle systems per scene | 16 (`MAX_PARTICLE_SYSTEMS`) | further `particle` objects are skipped (counted, `event=renderer.scene.particle_system_skip count=...`), never a rejection |
| live particles per system | 4096 (`MAX_PARTICLES`) | `maxCount` clamps to it; excess spawns drop, never evict; one bounded `particles_capped` per system |
| timestep | 1/60 s (`FIXED_STEP`) | fixed-step accumulator for oracle determinism |
| sim time per frame | ≤ 1.0 s (`MAX_ACCUMULATED_SIM_SECONDS` = 60 steps) | hostile `rate` factors can never stall the frame |
| wall dt per frame | ≤ 1.0 s (`MAX_FRAME_DT`) | a stalled frame is dropped, not stretched |
| spawn accumulator | 65536 due particles/step (`MAX_SPAWN_ACCUMULATOR`) | excess dropped, bounded |
| vertex buffer | 4096 × 6 verts × 40 B ≈ 983 KiB per system | one host-visible buffer, create-or-grow; contents rebuilt + re-uploaded every frame a fixed step ran |
| texture slots | `MAX_LAYERS` (256) + 16 particle slots = 272 | the M3c texture budget still applies per upload |

### External particle definition files (S4b)

**Implemented (S4b)**, replacing M3f's "the definition is never read" gap:
a `particle` object whose value is a STRING (a `.json` particle file
reference — pkg entry, scene directory, or `<assets>/particles/`) is now
resolved and parsed into a **component model** (emitter/initializer/
operator arrays, the real WE particle format), instead of always
registering with the flat model's all-default fixture.

**Resolution** (`crates/kwe-core/src/particlefile.rs`, shared by preflight
and the worker, mirroring the S1 model-resolution split): the file itself
(bounded 1 MiB JSON) → its own `material` field (a `.json` material path,
resolved exactly like a model layer's `material` via
`crates/kwe-core/src/scenemodel.rs`'s `resolve_material`) → `passes[0]` →
the first texture slot → `materials/<name>.tex`. The B2 honesty gate
(`SceneObjectSummary::particle_files_resolved`) counts a particle-file
system as drawable only when this whole chain resolves a real texture —
the same split S1 established for models; a reference that fails at any
step (missing file, invalid JSON, no `material` field, unresolvable
material/texture) keeps the M3f flat-model defaults, the pre-S4b honest
fallback, never a scene rejection.

**Component-model parse** (`crates/kwe-scene-renderer/src/particlefile.rs`,
worker-only — preflight never needs the simulation detail): every field is
read tolerantly (missing/malformed/out-of-range → a documented default or
clamp; an unrecognized emitter/initializer/operator `name` is skipped and
counted, never fatal, matching upstream's own "Unknown ... type" +
continue behavior). Implemented kinds (Borrowed-From:
`Almamu/linux-wallpaperengine`'s `Render/Objects/CParticle.cpp`,
GPL-3.0-or-later, adapted — see THIRD_PARTY.yml):

- **Emitters**: `boxrandom` (a per-axis random offset in
  `[distancemin, distancemax]`, sign randomized, scaled by `directions`,
  from `origin`) and `sphererandom` (a uniform-by-area point in the 2D
  annulus between `distancemin`/`distancemax`, scaled by `directions`; a
  declared `speedmin`/`speedmax` launches radially outward, otherwise an
  initializer sets velocity).
- **Initializers**: `lifetimerandom`, `sizerandom` (with `exponent` bias),
  `alpharandom`, `velocityrandom` (adds to the emitter's velocity),
  `colorrandom` (WE's 0..=255 range normalized to 0..=1).
- **Operators**: `movement` (gravity + drag, upstream's exact
  position-then-velocity order), `alphafade`, `sizechange`, `colorchange`
  (life-fraction-gated linear ramps against the particle's spawn-time
  values), `oscillatealpha`/`oscillatesize` (a per-particle cosine wave,
  frequency/phase drawn once at spawn), `controlpointattract` (a
  constant-force pull toward an anchor within a threshold radius), and
  `turbulence` (see the scope cut below).
- **Renderer**: the file's top-level `material` (not a per-renderer
  field) supplies the texture, drawn through the EXISTING M3f particle
  vertex/texture pipeline — no separate material-shader pipeline for
  particles.

**Documented scope cuts** (`crates/kwe-scene-renderer/src/particles.rs`'s
module doc has the full reasoning):

- **2D only**: every vector field's z component is parsed (bounds-checked)
  and dropped — matches every other scene2d object in this renderer; the
  sphere emitter always takes upstream's 2D-disk branch, never the 3D
  spherical-shell one.
- **No live control-point tracking**: `controlpointattract` anchors at the
  system's own spawn origin plus the operator's own `origin` offset,
  never a live mouse/audio-reactive control point (the `controlpoint`/
  `children`/audio-processing fields are tolerated, not read).
- **`turbulence` is a bounded deterministic APPROXIMATION** — a
  sine/cosine directional field sampled at each particle's own position
  plus a time term, NOT upstream's Perlin curl-noise algorithm. The
  per-operator `phase`/`speed` are still drawn once from the system's
  seeded PRNG (matching upstream's "once per operator instance" contract)
  so the approximation stays deterministic across identical runs.
- **Unimplemented, tolerated as unknown**: `rotationrandom`,
  `angularvelocityrandom`, `angularmovement` (this renderer's particle
  quads are always axis-aligned — no rotation attribute exists to drive),
  `oscillateposition`, `vortex`, `mapsequencearoundcontrolpoint`, and the
  `spritetrail` renderer (drawn as a plain sprite, not a trail).
- **`sizerandom`'s scale convention deliberately differs from upstream**:
  upstream halves the authored min/max before storing `p.size` because
  ITS renderer consumes that field as a half-extent directly; this
  renderer's single shared `build_vertex_bytes` already halves once
  (`half = size * 0.5`, the SAME convention the flat model's
  `sizeStart`/`sizeEnd` use), so `sizerandom` here feeds the authored
  value straight through — replicating upstream's extra `/2` would halve
  twice and render every authored size at a quarter scale.

**Bounds**: `MAX_PARTICLE_FILE_BYTES` (1 MiB, kwe-core); up to
`particles::MAX_COMPONENT_ITEMS` (16) emitters/initializers/operators each
(excess entries are dropped, not an error); every numeric field clamps to
a documented finite range at parse time (an emitter `rate` up to
100,000/s is allowed through uncapped — the actual per-frame spawn work
stays bounded by the existing `MAX_SPAWN_ACCUMULATOR`/`MAX_PARTICLES`
caps regardless); the system's own `max_count` and per-emitter `rate`
reuse the SAME `MAX_PARTICLES`/spawn-accumulator bounds the flat model
already enforces — a component-model system can never exceed the
existing per-system particle cap or do unbounded per-frame work, even
under a hostile/malformed file. `event=renderer.scene.particle_file_skip`
(one bounded line per scene load) reports how many file references failed
to resolve/decode; `event=renderer.scene.particle_file_unsupported_items`
reports unrecognized emitter/initializer/operator kinds seen.

## Image sources (M3c)

- **File scenes**: the reference is resolved against the canonicalized
  scene directory (symlink-escape-validated, exactly like scripts):
  relative with no `..`/absolute components, a regular file, at most
  `MAX_TEXTURE_SOURCE_BYTES` (64 MiB).
- **Pkg scenes**: the reference names a package entry (`kwe_core::image_entry`,
  case-insensitive — the literal path or the entry's tail after a `/`,
  exactly one match), read through the bounded reader; the host file
  system is never touched.

A missing, escaping, unreadable, or over-budget image **skips its layer**
with a bounded one-time diagnostic (`event=renderer.scene.layer_skip
layer=...`) — never the scene: the renderer stays healthy and the other
layers render. The same skip covers undecodable files and the total
texture budget.

Decoding (the `image` crate — see THIRD_PARTY.yml): PNG and JPEG always,
WebP when the crate builds with its webp feature. Bounds (textures.rs):
dimension ≤ 8192, pixels ≤ 16,777,216, decoded ≤ 64 MiB per texture,
source ≤ 64 MiB per texture, ≤ 256 MiB total across layers. Decoded
textures are RGBA8, uploaded as R8G8B8A8_UNORM (identity channel order —
the M3a readback lesson) with a shared linear clamp-to-edge sampler and a
per-layer descriptor set (pool capped at 256 sets).

## TEXV texture container (S1)

**Implemented (S1)** in `crates/kwe-scene-renderer/src/texv.rs`. Wallpaper
Engine ships raw textures (`.tex` files, always referenced under
`materials/`) in a container format distinct from PNG/JPEG: the TEXV
container. This decoder is adapted from linux-wallpaperengine's
`TextureParser.cpp`/`Texture.h` (GPL-3.0-or-later, see
docs/PROVENANCE.md and THIRD_PARTY.yml) and verified byte-for-byte against
real Workshop `.tex` payloads.

**Layout** (`TEXV0005` + `TEXI0001` header, then a `TEXB000{1..4}`
sub-container):

- Header: format enum, flags (`NoInterpolation`, `ClampUVs`, `IsGif`, ...),
  in-memory (power-of-2) width/height, and the "real" (unpadded) width/
  height.
- Format enum: `ARGB8888`, `RGB888`, `RGB565`, `DXT5`, `DXT3`, `DXT1`,
  `RG88`, `R8`, `RG1616f`, `R16f`, `BC7`, `RGBa1010102`, `RGBA16161616f`,
  `RGB161616f`. This decoder implements pixel decode for `ARGB8888`, `R8`,
  `RG88` (raw/expanded), `DXT1`/`DXT3`/`DXT5`/`BC7` (CPU block decode via
  the `texture2ddecoder` crate, MIT/Apache-2.0 — see THIRD_PARTY.yml); the
  others parse structurally but return an error on decode (not implemented,
  not a panic).
- **FIF-tagged payloads** (`TEXB0003`/`TEXB0004` with a `freeImageFormat`
  other than `FIF_UNKNOWN`, e.g. `FIF_PNG`, `FIF_JPEG`): the mip-0 payload
  is itself an encoded image file, decoded through the existing
  `textures::decode_texture` (the `image` crate) rather than the raw/BC
  path — no new decode logic needed for these, only the container
  envelope.
- Mipmap chain: per-image, per-mip width/height, an optional compression
  flag (`TEXB0002`+), and a declared uncompressed size. `compression == 1`
  means the payload is an **LZ4 block** (not a frame — `lz4_flex::block`
  with the declared size), decompressed with the declared size as the
  target buffer; only mip 0 of image 0 is decoded this slice.
- Animated textures (`TEXS0001`/`0002`/`0003`, gated by the `IsGif` flag):
  a per-frame timing/UV-rect table is parsed and kept
  (`DecodedTexv::frames`) but frame 0 — the same static mip-0 pixels — is
  what this slice draws.

**Output**: RGBA8 pixels, cropped to the top-left "real" width×height
region of the decoded mip (S1's simplification — no UV-scaling shader
stage exists yet, so the padded/pow2 buffer is physically cropped instead
of sampled with a UV offset). `ARGB8888`'s in-memory byte order is
already R,G,B,A (verified against upstream `CTexture.cpp`, which uploads
the raw bytes as `GL_RGBA`/`GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE` unchanged despite the
format's name) — no channel swizzle needed; `R8`/`RG88` expand to
grayscale/red-green RGBA with full alpha.

**Bounds**: per-edge dimension ≤ 8192 (in-memory, real, and every mip's
own declared size), mip count ≤ 16, image count ≤ 16, animation frame
count ≤ 8192, a `TEXB0004` mip's embedded editor-JSON string ≤ 64 KiB, and
— the decompression-bomb defense — a mip's declared uncompressed size
must equal exactly what its format+dimensions require (or, for a
BC-format mip, the block-count-derived size) before any LZ4 decompression
or block-decode allocation runs; a lying declared size is refused, never
trusted for allocation. Every failure path returns a value
(`Result`/`Option`), never panics, including on truncated or garbage
input (see `texv.rs`'s test module for the fuzz-ish truncation sweep).

## Model layers and material resolution (S1)

**Implemented (S1)** in `crates/kwe-core/src/scenemodel.rs`, shared by
preflight and the worker. In scene.json, `image` most commonly references
not a texture directly but a `.json` **model** file (620 of the 685
corpus image references in the researched sample): Wallpaper Engine
stores every visual, 2D included, as a model instance. Before S1 these
were skipped outright ("scene3d, this build does not render yet" — 46 of
60 local Workshop scenes were refused with no drawable content at all).

**S1 scope**: a model is drawn as a textured quad through the existing
image-layer pipeline — the same geometry fields (origin/angles/scale/
size/alpha/visible/blend/brightness/tint) an image layer uses, with a
resolved material texture as its pixel source. Mesh/puppet geometry,
custom material shaders, effect passes, and combos are **out of scope**
this slice; the resolver still parses and records them
(`ResolvedModel::shader/combos/blending/cullmode/depthtest/extra_textures`)
for the slice that implements them.

**Resolution walk** (adapted from linux-wallpaperengine's
`ModelParser.cpp`/`MaterialParser.cpp`/`Material.h` and
`AssetLocator::texture`, GPL-3.0-or-later — see THIRD_PARTY.yml):
`image` (a `.json` model path) → the model's `material` field (a `.json`
material path) → the material's `passes[0]` → the first non-null entry in
`passes[0].textures[]` → `materials/<name>.tex` (the texture-name-to-
asset-path rule every material texture reference follows, whether or not
the name itself carries subdirectories, e.g. `masks/foo` →
`materials/masks/foo.tex`).

**Lookup order** (caller-composed, `scenemodel::AssetLookup`): scene.pkg
entries first (pkg scenes), then the scene's own directory, then the
configured Wallpaper Engine assets root (`--assets-dir` on the worker,
`--wallpaper-engine-assets` on the daemon, `--assets-dir` on `kwe
preflight`; default: the first existing
`<steam root>/steamapps/common/wallpaper_engine/assets` over the
discovered Steam roots). Both `model.json` and `material.json` are bounded
to 1 MiB each and rejected as invalid JSON, not merely oversized-but-
parsed, past that cap; the resolver performs no file I/O itself — every
read goes through the caller's closure, so it never leaves kwe-core's
dependency-free boundary (the decoder that turns the resolved `.tex`
bytes into pixels, `texv.rs`, lives in kwe-scene-renderer, since
preflight only needs to know a texture's bytes exist, never decode them).

**Honesty (B2 contract)**: a model layer counts as **drawable** only when
its texture actually resolves through the lookup chain — unlike a direct
image reference, which counts as drawable statically even before its
bytes are known to decode, a model has no rendering pipeline at all
without a resolved texture. An unresolvable model's reason text is `N
model layer(s) whose material textures could not be resolved (missing
Wallpaper Engine assets?)`, replacing the old blanket "need scene3d"
message. Worker-side, a model whose texture fails to resolve or decode is
a degraded layer (skip-never-reject, like every other texture path) with
a bounded one-time diagnostic:
`event=renderer.scene.model_texture_skip count=N`.

## Material shaders (S2)

**Implemented (S2)**, replacing S1's "custom material shaders... are out
of scope" note: a model/image layer whose material pass shader
preprocesses, compiles, and binds draws through that MATERIAL PASS
SHADER — the WE look (tint/alpha/uv transforms, per-material combos, up
to 8 texture slots) — instead of S1's flat base-texture quad. Any
failure at any step falls back honestly to the S1 quad; a layer never
stops drawing because its material shader could not be used.

**Scope**: image/model layers only, quad geometry only (mesh/puppet
attribute layouts — bone weights, tangents, per-vertex color — are
**partially implemented as of S3**; see "Mesh/puppet" below for exactly
which shapes). Effect passes and FBO render-target chains (`_rt_*`
textures) are **implemented as of S3** — see "Effects and render
targets" below; the S2-era `render_target_reference` fallback (reject
any material whose live shader text mentioned `_rt_` at all) is gone,
since a `_rt_`/`Previous` texture slot now resolves to a live render
target or the shared dummy texture instead. Lighting objects remain
**out of scope**: `#require LightingV1` still resolves to a
zero-contribution stub.

**Preprocessor** (`crates/kwe-scene-renderer/src/shaderpre.rs`, adapted
from `ShaderUnit::preprocess`/`compile`, GPL-3.0-or-later — see
THIRD_PARTY.yml): `#include` resolution against
`<assets>/shaders/<name>.{vert,frag,h}`, with the `workshop/<id>/<file>`
→ `zcompat/scene/shaders/<id>/<file>` compat redirect
(`AssetLocator::shader`); the verbatim HLSL-compat header shim
(`mul`/`lerp`/`frac`/`float2`/`saturate`/`texSample2D`/... macros) plus
two Vulkan-only `#extension` pragmas upstream never needs (it targets
OpenGL 330 via a SPIRV-Cross round trip, not Vulkan SPIR-V directly);
`#require LightingV1` resolves to a stub (lighting objects are not
implemented — always zero contribution); `// [COMBO] {json}` combo
scraping and `uniform TYPE name; // {json}` parameter-metadata scraping;
combos as `#define NAME value` (a material's own `combos` map always
overrides a shader's scraped default). Bounded: include depth ≤ 8, total
preprocessed text ≤ 1 MiB, includes confined to the assets root
(`kwe_core::confined_read` — no traversal/symlink escape).

A second, Vulkan-specific pass (`fold_declarations`, no upstream
equivalent) rewrites every recognized `attribute`/`varying`/non-sampler-
`uniform` declaration into what Vulkan GLSL requires: explicit
`layout(location=)` on stage-interface variables (shared between the
vertex and fragment stages of one material so the two link correctly)
and `layout(set=0, binding=N)` on each `uniform sampler2D g_Texture<N>`.
Non-sampler uniforms fold into one fixed `MaterialUniforms` UBO
(`set=0, binding=8`) via `#define`: the WE standard set
(`g_ModelViewProjectionMatrix`, `g_Time`, `g_Texture<N>Resolution` —
doubling as texel size in `.zw` — `g_Texture<N>Rotation` (S4: identity
`vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0)`, not zero — see "Vertex attribute shapes
(S4)" below), `g_UserAlpha`, `g_Brightness`, `g_Color`, `g_Color4` (S4:
the same per-draw brightness/alpha as `g_Brightness`/`g_UserAlpha`,
packed into one vec4 — the `VERSION`-combo-gated replacement for that
pair in every `genericimage*` fragment shader), `g_ParallaxPosition`,
`g_Point0..7`, `g_PointerPosition`, `g_TexelSize`,
`g_EffectTextureProjectionMatrix`, and (S4a) `g_ModelMatrix`/
`g_ViewProjectionMatrix`/`g_NormalModelMatrix` plus their `Alt` siblings
— folded to `mat4(1.0)`/`mat3(1.0)` identity, not zero, since these feed
vertex POSITION (see "Vertex attribute shapes (S4)" below) — plus up to
16 of the material's own `constantshadervalues`, by name. Any other
uniform gets a local zero-valued declaration and a one-time diagnostic
(`event=renderer.scene.shader_unsupported_uniform`) — the shader still
compiles, that one value is just inert. This still includes genuinely
lighting-only uniforms such as `g_EyePosition`/`g_LightsPosition`,
matching `#require LightingV1`'s existing "always zero contribution"
scope limit — a material that genuinely needs real LIGHT/SHADING math
still draws, just without lighting; that is now a materially narrower
gap than before S4a, which also zero-defaulted the matrices feeding the
object's own screen POSITION.

**S4**: `fold_declarations`' scraping is now conditional-compilation-
AWARE — a bounded `#if`/`#ifdef`/`#ifndef`/`#elif`/`#else`/`#endif`
tracker (`shaderpre::evaluate_if_expr`, supporting `||`/`&&`/`==`/`!=`/
`!`/parens/`defined()`/bare identifiers, with an unparseable expression
falling back to "always live" rather than risk dropping a real
declaration) only scrapes/folds a declaration while every enclosing
`#if` branch is the one actually taken for the material's resolved
combos — matching what `shaderc`'s real GLSL preprocessor sees. Before
S4, the scraper picked up EVERY branch's declarations unconditionally
(dead and live alike), which both mis-shaped `AttributeDecl.location`
assignment (a dead branch's attribute could "steal" location 0, pushing
a live `a_TexCoord` to a location the compiled SPIR-V never actually
uses there) and made the vertex-format check see attribute NAMES from
the wrong branch entirely (`genericimage3.vert`'s `#if MORPHING
{ a_PositionVec4 } #else { a_Position }` scraped as attributes[0]=
`a_PositionVec4`, attributes[1]=`a_Position` even with `MORPHING`
off, since `a_TexCoord` landed at index 2). The `_rt_` render-target
check already asked `shaderc`'s own preprocessor for the LIVE text
before deciding (unaffected by this fix); `fold_declarations`'
attribute/varying/uniform scraping now gets the same treatment.

**Compilation** (`crates/kwe-scene-renderer/src/materialshader.rs`): the
`shaderc` crate against the SYSTEM `libshaderc` (default features — no
vendored glslang/spirv-tools build; `packaging/PKGBUILD` adds `shaderc`
as a dependency), target `Vulkan1_2`. Bounded: preprocessed text ≤
256 KiB, ≤ 64 distinct pipelines per scene (a scene with more distinct
materials keeps the S1 quad for the overflow); a `shaderc` failure comes
back as a value (`CompileError::Failed`), never a panic.

**Vulkan** (`crates/kwe-scene-renderer/src/vulkan.rs`): one compiled
`vk::Pipeline` per distinct `(shader, resolved combos, blend variant)`
key, cached and shared across every layer using the same material. A
material's descriptor set always declares 8 combined-image-samplers (an
unfilled slot samples a shared 1x1 transparent dummy texture — Vulkan
requires every statically-referenced descriptor to be valid) plus the
`MaterialUniforms` UBO. `g_ModelViewProjectionMatrix` is built directly
from the same 2D affine transform (`R(θ)·S(scale)·diag(size)`, world
units → NDC against `world_width`/`world_height`) the S1 push-constant
quad path already applies — a material draw and an S1 quad draw of the
same untinted, unbrightened layer land on IDENTICAL pixels (bit-exact:
`color.rgb *= g_Brightness` with the default 1.0 is an IEEE-754 no-op).
`g_Time` is a monotonic frame counter over an assumed 60 fps (not real
elapsed time — a documented simplification); `g_ParallaxPosition`/
`g_PointerPosition`/`g_Point0..7` default to zero (not wired to live
input this slice). `blending` maps onto the existing blend-attachment
table: `additive` → Add, everything else (`normal`, `translucent`,
unknown) → the same alpha-blended src-over every other layer uses.

**Diagnostics**: `event=renderer.scene.shader_fallback reason=... count=N`
once per distinct reason after load (`no_shader_name`,
`shader_source_missing`, `preprocess_failed`, `unsupported_vertex_format`,
`pipeline_cap`, `compile_failed`, `pipeline_creation_failed`,
`bind_failed`, and S3's `render_target_only_without_effects` — see
"Effects and render targets"), then
`event=renderer.scene.shaders compiled=N fallback=M` once. A material
that falls back stays covered by S1's `texture_ok`/base-texture path —
this step only ever ADDS a material draw on top, never removes one.

### `compile_failed` root causes fixed (S4b)

Priority item 4 of the S4b slice: the S4a change-log's 13 pkg-bundled
`compile_failed` shaders were traced to their actual root causes (not
just their `shaderc` error text) and four distinct preprocessor bugs
fixed — all four are `crates/kwe-scene-renderer/src/shaderpre.rs` changes,
none touch the material pipeline or Vulkan layer.

1. **`#include` placement** (`resolve_includes`): this module previously
   inlined an `#include`'s resolved text at its EXACT source position —
   documented at the time as equivalent to upstream's real behavior
   (`ShaderUnit::preprocessIncludes` collects every include's text and
   splices it in just before `main()`) because "every `#include` in the
   corpus sits at file scope above any function definition." That premise
   was false for three real corpus shaders — `shine_gaussian.frag`,
   `godrays_gaussian.frag`, `blur_precise_gaussian.frag` — which all
   `#include "common_blur.h"` as their FIRST line, before the
   `uniform sampler2D g_Texture0;` `common_blur.h`'s own `blur13`/`blur7`/
   `blur3` functions read. In-place inlining put those functions
   textually ahead of the declaration they depend on — `shaderc` reported
   `'g_Texture0' : undeclared identifier`. Fixed to match upstream's real
   placement: every `#include`'s resolved text is now collected into one
   accumulator (flattened across nesting, in encounter order) and spliced
   in just before the file's own `main(` definition, so every top-level
   declaration in the file — regardless of whether it sits before or
   after the `#include` line — is visible to whatever the included text
   defines. (S5 update: this S4b description of "just before `main(`"
   and "a combo-gated `main(` is not handled" is now the PRE-S5 behavior
   — see "Shader preprocessor: comment-aware `main` finder and
   declaration-aware include placement (S5)" below for the current,
   upstream-matching placement rule and the `#if`-stack search this
   paragraph originally deferred.)
2. **`g_Point<N>` type narrowing** (`standard_uniform_expr`): the shared
   `MaterialUniforms` UBO backs every `g_Point<N>` with a `vec4` slot, but
   `effects/perspective.vert` (used by the large majority of the local
   corpus's effect chains — `common_perspective.h`'s `squareToQuad`
   helper) declares it locally as `uniform vec2 g_Point0;` and calls
   `squareToQuad(vec2, vec2, vec2, vec2)`. Folding to the bare `vec4`
   expression changed the CALL-SITE type — `shaderc` reported
   `'squareToQuad' : no matching overloaded function found` (a function
   that exists, called with the wrong argument type) and a cascading
   `'inverse' : no matching overloaded function found` plus a `'=' :
   cannot convert from const float to 3x3 matrix` on the very same line.
   Fixed: the folded expression now carries a narrowing swizzle (`.xy`
   for a `vec2` declaration, `.xyz` for `vec3`, none for `vec4` — the
   common case, byte-identical to the pre-fix output) matching the
   shader's OWN declared type, scraped by the same `parse_decl` call that
   already reads the type for every other declaration path.
3. **Array uniforms left as loose declarations** (`fold_declarations`):
   an array-typed uniform (e.g. `uniform float g_AudioSpectrum16Left
   [16];`, an audio-visualizer material's spectrum-band uniform — this
   renderer does not feed live spectrum data into any shader) was
   explicitly excluded from every folding path (the standard-uniform,
   material-constant, and zero-default branches all guard on `!name.
   contains('[')`) and fell through to the generic per-line pass-through,
   leaving the ORIGINAL `uniform TYPE NAME[N];` line in the compiled
   text. Vulkan's GLSL profile requires every non-opaque uniform to live
   inside a named block — `shaderc` reported `'non-opaque uniforms
   outside a block' : not allowed when using GLSL for Vulkan`. Fixed: an
   array uniform of a recognized element type now gets the same "still
   compiles, just inert" zero-default treatment as a scalar/vector
   uniform — a NON-`uniform`, explicitly zero-initialized array
   (`TYPE NAME[N] = TYPE[N](zero, zero, ...)`, GLSL has no broadcast
   shorthand for array initializers) the rest of the shader can still
   read by the same name. Bounded: `MAX_ZERO_ARRAY_LEN` (1024 elements,
   generous over the local corpus's largest real array, 64) — a
   declaration past that bound is left on the pre-existing pass-through
   path (still `compile_failed`, never an unbounded initializer-list
   string).
4. **`max()` argument order** (`SHADER_HEADER`): `#define max(x, y)
   max(y, x)` is upstream's OWN header macro, dropped from this
   module's port on the theory that GLSL already defines `max` the same
   way HLSL does. That theory missed the actual corpus shape: HLSL's
   `max(scalar, vecN)` broadcasts regardless of argument position, but
   GLSL's overload set only has `genType max(genType x, float y)` — the
   scalar must be SECOND, and an integer literal like the bare `0` in
   `max(0, albedo.rgb)` (`workshop/2423477561/effects/nitro.frag`,
   `workshop/2988515046/effects/nitro.frag` — both pkg-bundled) needs
   GLSL's int→float implicit conversion on that second-position argument
   to resolve at all. `shaderc` reported `'max' : no matching overloaded
   function found` for the un-swapped call. Restored upstream's macro
   verbatim; safe as a blanket swap because `max` is mathematically
   commutative for any call that already resolves correctly — swapping a
   currently-working `max(vector, scalar)` call changes nothing but
   argument ORDER in the generated text, not the computed value, and the
   full local-corpus sweep (below) found no case where the corpus itself
   relies on the un-swapped order.

Pinned by `shaderpre.rs` unit tests for each fix
(`include_content_lands_before_main_not_at_its_own_line_position`,
`point_uniform_narrows_to_the_shaders_own_declared_type`,
`array_uniform_zero_fills_instead_of_leaving_a_loose_declaration`,
`max_macro_swaps_arguments_matching_upstreams_header`, plus bounds/
hostile-input siblings for each). See the S4b change-log entry in
`AI-Skills/BETA_PLAN.md` for the before/after corpus `compile_failed`
count and the byte-identity sweep result.

### Shader preprocessor: comment-aware `main` finder and declaration-aware include placement (S5)

Two adversarial-review follow-ups on the S4b `#include`-placement fix
above, both `crates/kwe-scene-renderer/src/shaderpre.rs` only:

1. **Comment-aware `main` finder** (`find_main_token`): the pre-S5 scan
   matched a bare `main` token anywhere in the preprocessed text — a
   shader with `main` mentioned inside a `//` line comment or a `/* */`
   block comment ABOVE its real `main(` definition (e.g. `// see main()
   above` or a commented-out old entry point) would be mistaken for the
   real one, splicing included text into the wrong place. `find_main_
   token` now tracks comment state as it scans (a single linear pass) so
   both comment styles are skipped; an unterminated block comment runs
   to end-of-file, matching how a real GLSL compiler would treat the
   same malformed input. This is an original robustness fix, not a port
   — upstream's own `find(" main")` has the identical weakness.
2. **Declaration/`#if`-aware include placement** (`find_include_
   insertion_point`, `move_point_outside_conditionals`): the S4b fix
   spliced every `#include`'s resolved text unconditionally right before
   `main(`, documented at the time as "equivalent for every shader this
   renderer has been measured against" because none of the then-covered
   corpus shaders needed the real, upstream-matching search
   (`ShaderUnit::preprocessIncludes`, `ShaderUnit.cpp:136-312`): insert
   immediately after the LAST top-level `attribute`/`varying`/`uniform`
   declaration before `main` (not merely before `main` itself), then walk
   that point back outside any `#if`/`#ifdef`/`#ifndef` ... `#endif`
   region it would otherwise land inside. This closes a REAL bug the old
   rule would have hit on `blur_precise_gaussian.frag` (one of the S4b
   fix targets itself) if its last declaration before `main` were ever
   inside a conditional block — `blur_precise_gaussian.frag` declares
   `varying vec2 v_TexCoordMask;` behind `#if MASK`, AFTER its last
   unconditional `uniform`; splicing `common_blur.h`'s `blur13a`/`blur7a`/
   `blur3a` function definitions inside that `#if MASK` block would leave
   them undefined whenever a material has `MASK` off — the `#if`-stack
   walk moves the insertion point back to right after the last
   UNCONDITIONAL declaration instead, avoiding it entirely. All three
   S4b fix-target shaders (`shine_gaussian.frag`, `godrays_gaussian.frag`,
   `blur_precise_gaussian.frag`) still preprocess and compile to SPIR-V
   after this rewrite — verified directly against the real WE asset tree
   by `shaderpre::tests::s4b_fix_target_shaders_still_compile_after_
   the_placement_rewrite` (skipped, not failed, when the assets tree is
   not mounted — a local-verification test over real, un-committed
   assets, matching this module's other asset-path-gated tests).

Pinned by `shaderpre.rs` unit tests: `find_main_token_skips_line_and_
block_comments`, `find_main_token_returns_none_when_main_only_appears_
in_comments`, `find_main_token_handles_an_unterminated_block_comment`,
`include_splices_after_the_last_top_level_declaration_before_main`,
`include_splice_point_is_moved_outside_an_enclosing_if_block`,
`include_splice_point_handles_nested_if_blocks`.

## Effects and render targets (S3)

**Implemented (S3)**: an object's `effects[]` array — an ordered list of
effect-chain references, each naming an effect `.json` file
(`effects/<name>/effect.json` in the real corpus) plus per-object pass
overrides (combos/textures/usertextures/constantshadervalues, matched
positionally to the effect file's own MATERIAL passes only — command
passes consume no override). An effect file declares `fbos[]` (name/
format/scale/`unique`, sized to the OWNING OBJECT's own pixel size ÷
`scale` — not the scene's) and an ordered `passes[]`, each either a
material pass (`material`, optional `bind` list, optional `target` FBO
name) or a `command` (`copy`/`swap`, `source`/`target` names).

**Resolution** (`crates/kwe-core/src/sceneeffect.rs`, adapted from
`EffectParser.cpp`/`ObjectParser::parseEffect`/`CPass::
setupTextureUniforms`'s texture-slot priority order, GPL-3.0-or-later —
see THIRD_PARTY.yml): every texture-slot name is classified once, no
GPU/render-time knowledge needed — a `_rt_`/`_alias_`-prefixed name is a
live render target (`is_runtime_target_name`), the literal string
`"previous"` is the chain-local "reuse the input this slot would
otherwise have used" sentinel, anything else is a normal `.tex` asset
resolved and TEXV-header-checked exactly like a base material's texture
slot. **Honesty rule**: resolving an object's `effects[]` NEVER fails
the object — a malformed or unresolvable effect entry (missing file,
unresolvable declared texture, malformed JSON) is simply omitted from
the resolved list; the object keeps drawing through its base material
(or nothing, if that was already unresolvable) exactly as if it had no
`effects[]` at all. Bounded: ≤ 32 effects/object, ≤ 16 passes/effect,
≤ 16 fbos/effect, effect JSON ≤ 1 MiB.

**`_rt_` runtime-target honesty fix**: before S3, a material's texture
slot naming `_rt_FullFrameBuffer` (the corpus's `models/util/
fullscreenlayer.json` `copybackground` utility material's ONLY texture)
unconditionally tried `materials/_rt_FullFrameBuffer.tex` on disk — a
path that can never exist — failing model resolution outright. This was
the exact defect keeping Workshop scene `1652229298` refused after S1/S2
(BETA_PLAN.md). `scenemodel::resolve_model` now recognizes a
`_rt_`/`_alias_`-prefixed slot-0 name as resolved-but-render-target
(empty bytes, `is_render_target: true`) instead of a filesystem lookup —
the B2 honesty gate passes, and the object's real pixel content is
decided by the renderer's effect chain at draw time.

**Render pipeline mapping** (`crates/kwe-scene-renderer/src/vulkan.rs`):
upstream draws every material pass as its OWN draw call, either into a
named FBO (`target: Some(name)`) or, with no target, directly onto the
compositor. This renderer maps that onto its existing single-composite-
pass architecture: **the chain's LAST pass with no target REPLACES the
layer's own base material** for compile/bind purposes (a layer with a
resolved effect chain draws through the effect's own final shader, not
its base material). Every OTHER pass — one with a `target`, PLUS (S5)
any untargeted pass that is NOT the chain's last one — gets its own
compiled pipeline (`compile_effect_pass` — a separate, uncached pipeline
object per pass, since its viewport is the TARGET's own pixel size, not
the canvas: this renderer's pipelines bake a static, non-dynamic
viewport) and is RE-RENDERED into its FBO every frame
(`render_effect_chains`, called before the main composite pass each
frame) so later passes and the layer's own final draw sample fresh
content. A targeted pass's FBO is the scene-declared `fbos[]` name
(scoped, see below); an intermediate untargeted pass's FBO is this
OBJECT's own reused ping-pong pair — see "Stacked multi-effect
compositing (S5)" below. `command: copy` executes as a direct
`vkCmdCopyImage` between two named FBOs; `command: swap` — upstream
itself never executes `swap` (`CImage.cpp` only handles `Command_Copy`)
— executes identically to `copy` in this renderer, since a true pointer
swap would require re-resolving every LATER pass's already-baked
descriptor-set view bindings each frame, which this renderer's
load-time-only binding design does not support.

**`"previous"` seeding**: for the FIRST pass in an object's whole effect
chain, `"previous"` resolves to the object's OWN base material's slot-0
content — its real photo texture if it has one, or `_rt_FullFrameBuffer`
if its base material's slot 0 is itself empty or already a render target
(the `copybackground` pattern). Getting this right matters: seeding it
to `_rt_FullFrameBuffer` unconditionally would make an ordinary photo
layer's colour-grade effect sample the (one-frame-stale, initially
transparent) scene composite instead of its own photo — a real
corpus-observed failure mode caught and fixed during this slice (see the
"safety guard" note below and `main.rs::plan_effect_chain`'s doc
comment).

**`_rt_FullFrameBuffer`**: a copy of the composited scene so far — see
"Stacked multi-effect compositing / `_rt_FullFrameBuffer` paint order
(S5)" below for the full, current semantics (a genuine same-frame
snapshot for a layer's own bound material; still one-frame-stale for an
effect chain's internal references, as S3 originally shipped it).

**Safety guard — bare `_rt_` passthrough without an effect chain**: a
layer whose EFFECTIVE material (its own base material, since it has no
resolved `effects[]`) has NOTHING but `_rt_`/render-target texture slots
— no real `.tex` bytes anywhere — never draws
(`render_target_only_without_effects` fallback reason), UNLESS (S5) its
only render-target reference is `_rt_FullFrameBuffer` specifically —
that case is now safe (see S5 below) and draws. This is exactly the
corpus's bare `models/util/fullscreenlayer.json` pattern used WITHOUT an
attached effect (several real scenes place one at a fixed point in
their object stack purely as a `copybackground` utility, with no
`effects[]` of its own): before S3 its unresolvable `_rt_
FullFrameBuffer` slot meant the whole object silently never drew — a
true no-op. S3 kept refusing it even once the slot resolved, because
`_rt_FullFrameBuffer` was only ever the one-frame-stale, transparent-
on-frame-1 whole-scene snapshot — drawing it at any point in the object
stack could paint stale/black content over real same-frame content. S5
makes `_rt_FullFrameBuffer` a genuine same-frame snapshot for exactly
this pattern (a layer's own bound material sampling it directly), so it
is now safe to draw; any OTHER bare render-target reference (a name
this layer's own effects never wrote, which should not occur in a
well-formed scene) still has nothing real to show and stays refused.
This guard was found and fixed via the corpus regression sweep
documented in `AI-Skills/BETA_PLAN.md`'s S3 entry, not by inspection
alone — real Workshop content exercises it.

**Per-object render-target namespace** (adversarial review RECOMMENDED
#5): every effect-declared FBO name — a `fbos[]` entry, a pass's own
`target`, a `bind`/texture-slot reference, a `command`'s literal
`source`/`target` — is scoped to the declaring LAYER
(`main.rs::scoped_target_name`, suffixing `#obj<layer_index>`) before it
ever reaches the renderer's `effect_targets` map, EXCEPT the one
deliberately scene-wide name, `_rt_FullFrameBuffer`, which stays global.
Two different objects declaring the same raw `fbos[]` name can no
longer alias — an object whose chain runs but whose final pass is not
applied (the scope boundary below) cannot silently feed a different
object's same-named target, because the two objects' declared names
never collide in the first place.

**Feedback-loop guard** (adversarial review MUST-FIX #3): a targeted
material pass whose own resolved texture slots (via `bind`,
`usertextures`, `textures`, or the base material) name the SAME `_rt_*`
FBO the pass itself renders into is rejected before compilation
(`effect_self_reference` fallback reason) — sampling an image through a
descriptor set while it is bound as the color attachment being written
in the same render-pass instance is an unguarded Vulkan feedback loop
(undefined per spec absent `VK_EXT_attachment_feedback_loop_layout`),
mirroring `copy_effect_target`'s existing `source == target` guard for
the analogous command-pass case.

**Bounds**: `MAX_EFFECT_TARGETS_PER_SCENE` = 64 live FBOs/scene,
`MAX_EFFECT_TARGET_BYTES` = 256 MiB cumulative, `MAX_EFFECT_TARGET_
DIMENSION` = 4096 px/side, `MAX_EFFECT_PASS_BINDINGS` = 256 compiled
effect-pass pipelines/scene (its own dedicated `effect_descriptor_pool`
as of the adversarial review's MUST-FIX #1 — previously shared with
`material_descriptor_pool`'s `MAX_LAYERS` budget with no combined
accounting), `MAX_EFFECT_FRAME_ACTIONS` = 512 queued per-frame
`command`/render actions per scene (MUST-FIX #2 — a `command` pass
needs neither a shader nor a texture asset to parse, so nothing else
bounded how many a hostile `effects[]`/`effect.json` pair could queue
before this fix), `MAX_EFFECT_ASSET_READ_BYTES` = 256 MiB cumulative
across every effect-triggered asset read per scene load (RECOMMENDED
#4) — all enforced in `vulkan.rs`/`main.rs`, independent of the
parse-time caps in `kwe-core::sceneeffect`.

**Diagnostics**: `event=renderer.scene.effect_fallback reason=...
count=N` per distinct reason (`compile_failed`, `effect_self_reference`,
`effect_frame_action_cap`), then `event=renderer.scene.effects
objects=N passes=M fallback=K targets=T swap_used=S` once per scene
load — only emitted when at least one layer has a resolved effect
chain. `swap_used` (adversarial review NIT #7) counts how many resolved
`command: swap` entries executed as a one-directional copy (see
"Render pipeline mapping" above) — distinguishing that simplification's
real-world exposure from `command: copy`, where it is a no-op
difference. A separate `event=renderer.scene.effect_asset_budget_exceeded
bytes=... cap=...` line (RECOMMENDED #4) fires once if the aggregate
effect-asset read budget is hit during scene load.

## Stacked multi-effect compositing / `_rt_FullFrameBuffer` paint order (S5)

S3 shipped two deliberate, documented boundaries: an effect chain's own
output only ever replaced a bare-passthrough base material (real photos
with attached effects kept drawing their unmodified base texture, since
the chain model had nowhere to put an intermediate untargeted pass), and
`_rt_FullFrameBuffer` was a whole-scene, one-frame-stale snapshot. S5
closes both.

**Effect compositing rule**: every pass in an object's resolved chain
(every visible `effects[]` entry's `passes[]`, concatenated in file
order — `main.rs::plan_effect_chain`) is now real:

- A **targeted** pass (`target: Some(name)`) renders into that
  scene-declared `fbos[]` name, scoped to the object
  (`scoped_target_name`) — unchanged from S3.
- An **untargeted, non-last** pass — the new S5 case — renders into this
  OBJECT's own PRIVATE, reused ping-pong pair (`pingpong_target_name`,
  upstream's `_rt_imageLayerComposite_<id>_a`/`_b`,
  `CImage.cpp:729-880`): AT MOST 2 targets per object regardless of how
  many intermediate passes it has, alternating after each write. Pass 1
  of a chain samples the object's OWN base material's real texture
  directly (no FBO needed for that — the seed `plan_effect_chain`
  already used since S3); every later pass samples whatever the
  previous pass just wrote.
- The **untargeted, last** pass in the whole chain becomes
  `final_material` — this layer's own bound material, exactly as S3 —
  now unconditionally, regardless of whether the base material had a
  real texture of its own.

The S3-era `base_is_passthrough` gate (restricting the override to
bare-passthrough objects only) is removed: it existed purely because the
old chain model had no real GPU target for an intermediate untargeted
pass, so letting the chain's last pass win for a real-photo object with
multiple stacked effects (the corpus's own worked example, Workshop
`1131061888`'s "trigun" — a real photo with FOUR attached effects:
waterripple/waterflow/godrays/waterwaves) discarded the photo outright.
With a real per-object ping-pong pair, pass 1 still samples the real
photo, so nothing is discarded. Bounds: ≤ 2 ping-pong targets per object
(within the existing `MAX_EFFECT_TARGETS_PER_SCENE`/`MAX_EFFECT_TARGET_
BYTES` scene-wide caps), ≤ 16 passes/effect (unchanged, parse-time cap).
Pinned by `main.rs::tests::plan_effect_chain_ping_pongs_multiple_
untargeted_passes_reusing_two_targets`,
`plan_effect_chain_ping_pong_targets_stay_bounded_to_two`, and
`plan_effect_chain_targeted_passes_do_not_consume_ping_pong_slots`.

**`_rt_FullFrameBuffer` same-frame paint order**: a layer whose OWN
bound material (its base material, or an effect chain's `final_material`
— the thing actually drawn through the normal per-layer quad) samples
`_rt_FullFrameBuffer` now sees the scene composited so far THIS SAME
FRAME — every layer drawn earlier in object order — not last frame's
whole-scene snapshot. Implemented in
`vulkan::LayerRenderer::render`: `main.rs::compile_material_layers`
collects the layer indices whose final bound material references
`_rt_FullFrameBuffer` by name (`ffb_consumer_layers`, capped at
`MAX_FULL_FRAME_BUFFER_SNAPSHOTS_PER_FRAME` = 8, one bounded diagnostic
— `event=renderer.scene.full_frame_buffer_snapshot_cap` — if truncated)
and hands it to `render`, which, immediately before each registered
layer's draw, ENDS the current render-pass instance, copies
`self.image`'s current content into `_rt_FullFrameBuffer`
(`vkCmdCopyImage` with the same barrier pattern the pre-existing
`copy_effect_target`/`snapshot_full_frame_buffer` already use), then
RESUMES drawing in a new render-pass instance (`render_pass_resume`,
`LOAD_OP_LOAD`) — all within the SAME command buffer/submit as the rest
of the frame, no extra fence wait. A consumer past the 8-cap is not
refused; it simply is not given its own snapshot point, so it samples
whatever `_rt_FullFrameBuffer` last held (the most recent snapshot
inserted earlier this frame, or the previous frame's whole-scene content
if none was — a documented, bounded degrade). This directly unblocks
the "safety guard" case above: a bare `copybackground` passthrough with
no effect chain, sampling `_rt_FullFrameBuffer` as its only texture,
now draws correctly instead of being refused. Pinned by
`vulkan::tests::full_frame_buffer_snapshot_sees_layers_drawn_earlier_
this_same_frame` (a two-renderer, treatment-vs-control device test:
layer 1 mirrors layer 0's red WITH the snapshot registered, and mirrors
opaque black WITHOUT it — proving the mechanism, not a coincidence),
verified on both an NVIDIA RTX 3070 and llvmpipe.

**Scope boundary — the same-frame fix covers a layer's OWN bound
material only**: an effect chain's INTERNAL references to
`_rt_FullFrameBuffer` (a pass's own texture slot naming it directly, or
`plan_effect_chain`'s "previous" seed falling back to it when the base
material has no real texture) are NOT covered — `render_effect_chains`
still runs once, in one batch, before ANY layer's on-screen draw this
frame, so an effect pass reading `_rt_FullFrameBuffer` still sees the
PREVIOUS frame's whole-scene snapshot (`main.rs`'s post-`render` call to
`snapshot_full_frame_buffer`, unchanged from S3). Interleaving effect-
chain execution into true per-object paint order — running each
object's own chain actions at its own position in the draw loop, rather
than as one bulk pre-pass — would close this remaining gap; it was
judged out of scope for this slice (a bigger architectural change to
`render_effect_chains`'s per-frame replay model, not a bounded addition
like the render-pass-split mechanism above) and is a real, scoped
follow-up.

**Design note — why a render-pass split, not a second subpass**: a
subpass-local dependency can transition an attachment's LAYOUT between
subpasses of the SAME render-pass instance, but `_rt_FullFrameBuffer` is
a separate image/framebuffer entirely, and the copy into it is a
TRANSFER command (`vkCmdCopyImage`), which is illegal inside a
render-pass instance regardless of subpass count. Ending the instance is
therefore the only construct that admits this at all, not an
optimization traded away — see `vulkan::LayerRenderer::render`'s own doc
comment for the full barrier/layout proof (both `render_pass` and the
new `render_pass_resume` share the exact `final_layout`/`initial_layout`
the snapshot's copy step needs, so no manual image-layout barrier on
`self.image` itself is needed at any split point).

## Vertex attribute shapes (S4) / mesh/puppet vertex formats

**Implemented (S4)**: the material pipeline's shared quad buffer
(`vulkan::MATERIAL_UNIT_QUAD`) now carries constant per-vertex data for
SIX attribute names instead of two — `a_Position`(vec2/vec3) and
`a_TexCoord`(vec2) as before, plus `a_Normal`(vec3, always `+Z` — the
quad is flat), `a_Color`(vec4, always opaque white), `a_PositionVec4`
(vec4, mirrors `a_Position` with z=0/w=1), and `a_TexCoordVec4`(vec4,
mirrors `a_TexCoord` with z=0/w=1) — see `vulkan::material_attribute_layout`.
`main.rs::material_vertex_format_supported` accepts any subset of these
six names (each with its matching declared GLSL type, no duplicates)
that includes at least one position-like and one texcoord-like
attribute; `vulkan::material_vertex_attributes` builds each pipeline's
`VertexInputAttributeDescription` list dynamically from the material's
OWN scraped, live-only attribute set (see the S4 conditional-compilation
scraping fix above) instead of a hardcoded 2-attribute array. This is
squarely the `genericimage3`/`genericimage4`-family shape upstream's
`CImage`/`CPass` feed a flat 2D image object — mesh/puppet geometry
(bone indices/weights, tangents, the multi-UV-channel `C1`/`C2`/...
variants used only by rope/mesh particle shaders) stays out of this
slice, per the survey below.

**A second, load-bearing S4 fix**: two WE "standard" uniforms this
pipeline previously zero-defaulted turned out to be genuinely LIVE (not
dead behind an off-by-default combo) for a `VERSION`-tagged
`genericimage*` material, and a zero default for either one visibly
BREAKS the draw — found via the 60-scene corpus byte-identity sweep
(`scripts/scene-corpus-byte-identity-sweep.sh`), which flagged 8
real regressions the first time this slice widened the vertex-format
acceptance without also fixing these:
- `g_Texture<N>Rotation` (vec4): the UV transform every
  `genericimage*.vert` applies unconditionally
  (`v_TexCoord.xy = g_Texture<N>Translation + a_TexCoord.x *
  g_Texture<N>Rotation.xy + a_TexCoord.y * g_Texture<N>Rotation.zw`) —
  a zero ROTATION matrix collapses every sampled UV to one point. Fixed
  to the identity `vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0)`. (`g_Texture<N>Translation`
  needed no change: `vec2(0.0)` already IS the correct identity
  translation for the same formula.)
- `g_Color4` (vec4): the `VERSION`-combo-gated replacement for the
  `g_Brightness`/`g_UserAlpha` pair every `genericimage*.frag` otherwise
  uses (`#ifndef VERSION { ...g_Brightness/g_UserAlpha... } #else {
  uniform vec4 g_Color4; ... color *= g_Color4; }`) — a zero `g_Color4`
  multiplies the sampled colour to fully transparent black for every
  `VERSION`-tagged material. Fixed to fold to the SAME per-draw
  brightness/alpha values already threaded through
  `u_Std.g_TimeAlphaBrightness_` (`vec4(...zzz, ...y)`), matching what
  the `g_Brightness`/`g_UserAlpha` branch already does.

Both are pinned by direct unit tests
(`shaderpre::tests::texture_rotation_uniform_folds_to_identity_not_zero`,
`shaderpre::tests::color4_uniform_folds_to_brightness_alpha_not_zero`)
and confirmed against the real corpus scene that surfaced them (Workshop
3100709479, a `genericimage3` material): after both fixes, its render
output is byte-identical to the pre-S4 baseline's own (already-correct)
S1 fallback, while now drawing through the REAL material pipeline
instead of a flat textured quad.

**S4a adversarial review, MUST-FIX #3**: a third, related "zero should be
identity" gap survived the original S4 pass and the 60-scene sweep —
`g_ModelMatrix`/`g_ViewProjectionMatrix`/`g_NormalModelMatrix` (+ `Alt`
siblings) also fell through to the generic zero-default. Unlike
`g_EyePosition`/lighting math (genuinely out of scope — `#require
LightingV1` still resolves to a zero-contribution stub), these three feed
vertex **POSITION**, not just shading: `genericimage3.vert:163`'s
`worldPos = mul(vec4(localPos, 1.0), g_ModelMatrix)` runs
UNCONDITIONALLY on every draw of this shader family, and once a material
sets `LIGHTING=1` (a legitimate combo override on the very same
`a_Normal`/`a_Color` attribute family S4 widened acceptance to),
`gl_Position` itself is computed from `worldPos * g_ViewProjectionMatrix`
— two zero matrices collapsing the object's on-screen geometry to a
single degenerate point, not "missing lighting." None of the 60 local
corpus scenes happen to set `LIGHTING`/`REFLECTION`/`VERTEXCOLOR` on a
`genericimage2/3/4`-family material, so the sweep could not have caught
this the way it caught the two fixes above — found by adversarial review
instead. Fixed the same way: `g_ModelMatrix`/`g_AltModelMatrix`/
`g_ViewProjectionMatrix`/`g_AltViewProjectionMatrix` fold to `mat4(1.0)`;
`g_NormalModelMatrix`/`g_AltNormalModelMatrix` fold to `mat3(1.0)` —
pinned by `shaderpre::tests::model_and_view_projection_matrices_fold_to_identity_not_zero`.
This is still not real lighting/reflection support (a material whose live
combo state needs `g_EyePosition` for real, non-zero shading still draws
without it, unchanged), and two more unconditional-declaration `mat4`
uniforms were found by the same grep but left unfixed as out of this
finding's specific scope (`g_EffectModelMatrix`, read unconditionally in
`volumetricsfront.frag`'s raymarch; `g_EffectModelViewProjectionMatrix`,
read unconditionally in `effectcomposebackground.vert`'s screen-coord
compute — both single-shader-file, effect-pass-only names, not the
widely-used image-object family this review targeted) — recorded here as
a known residual gap, not silently dropped.

**Residual sweep findings, not further chased this slice**: after both
fixes, the 60-scene sweep's flagged count is higher than the 8 found
before the fix (most scenes newly draw REAL content where they
previously drew nothing at all — `unsupported_vertex_format` no longer
refuses them — which the pixel-stat sweep reports as "flagged" even
though it is the intended, desired effect of this deliverable, not a
regression; every scene that already drew a real photo through its
material pre-S4 remains byte-identical post-S4). One scene (Workshop
3765081478, a heavily custom "cloud"-style shader with 59 distinct
non-standard `u_`-prefixed uniform names, only 46 of 53 materials
compiling even after this fix) draws visibly different, near-uniform-
white content post-S4 and is flagged here as a known, out-of-scope
residual gap for a future slice to look at with real screenshots, not
silently accepted as correct.

**Deliberately left out** (documented, not silently dropped): a survey
of the WE asset shader corpus (`assets/shaders/*.vert`) found the
attribute shapes this renderer still does NOT implement, all involving
at least one attribute outside the six-name known set: `a_Position(vec3)
+ a_Normal(vec3)` alone, no UV (7 shaders — lighting-only positions;
these need `#require LightingV1`'s real implementation, out of scope),
bone/skinning attributes (`a_BlendIndices`/`a_BlendWeights`, live only
when a material explicitly sets `SKINNING=1`, not observed in the local
corpus), tangents (`a_Tangent4`, live with `NORMALMAP`/`REFLECTION`),
and the rope/mesh-particle multi-UV-channel variants
(`a_TexCoordVec4C1`/`C2`/`C3`, `a_TexCoordVec3C2`, `a_PositionC1`,
`a_TexCoordC2`/`C3`/`C4` — `genericropeparticle.vert`,
`puppettexturechannels.vert`'s remaining non-standard channels). Adding
support for any of these is a real, scoped follow-up (extending
`vulkan::KNOWN_MATERIAL_ATTRIBUTES`/`material_attribute_layout` and
`main.rs::material_vertex_format_supported`'s matcher to a wider known
set, plus deciding what constant per-vertex data — if any — a flat quad
can meaningfully supply for a bone-weighted or multi-channel attribute).

**Puppet MESH geometry (custom triangle lists, not just attribute
shape)**: upstream's only mesh-beyond-the-quad path is a `model.json`
`puppet` field naming a binary blob (magic `MDLV0021`/`MDLV0023`, a
heuristically-scanned vertex/index block — stride-80 vertices,
position(vec3) at offset 0 + uv(vec2) at offset 72, u16 index triples;
CImage.cpp's own comment gives no name to the 64 bytes between offset
12 and 72, and no other code path reads them). Critically, upstream's
puppet vertex SHADER uses the SAME two attributes (`a_Position`+
`a_TexCoord`) as the flat quad — puppet is a GEOMETRY change (many
triangles instead of 6 quad vertices), not a vertex-FORMAT change. **Not
ported this slice**: a full grep of this machine's local `assets/
models/*.json` (6 files) found zero `"puppet"` keys, and the local
60-scene Workshop corpus's packed `scene.pkg` model.json entries were
not exhaustively re-checked for `puppet` fields given the time budget —
treat puppet mesh support as implemented-nowhere, not
implemented-but-unexercised, until a real fixture is found. Given zero
observed local usage, this is left out with the reason recorded here
rather than built against a synthetic-only fixture with no real-corpus
signal to validate it against.

## scene.pkg

**Implemented (M3b)** in `kwe-core` (`crates/kwe-core/src/pkg.rs`) and wired
into the worker's `--content` path: a `.pkg` content is opened by
`PkgReader`, its unique `scene.json` entry is parsed in memory, and — when
`general.script` names a package entry — that entry is extracted into a
private `kwe-scene-script-<pid>` directory under the worker's HOME (mode
0700) and loaded like a file scene's script. Model, material, and texture
references resolve against the package entry table too (S1,
`scenemodel::resolve_model`'s pkg-lane lookup, `kwe_core::asset_entry`) —
`materials`/`models` subtrees are not bulk-extracted, only the specific
entries a resolved model layer needs; the renderer logs
`event=renderer.scene.pkg entries=N script_entry=...`.

The **extension selects the reader**: `--content` ending in `.json` takes
the file-based parse, `.pkg` takes the archive reader — and mislabeled
content fails *as its labeled format* (a pkg renamed `.json` is parsed as
JSON and rejected, and vice versa).

The extracted script directory is the worker's own: it is removed on the
worker's graceful exit path, and a stale directory left by a hard kill is
replaced by the pid-recycle retry on the next start (never a brick).

### Verified layout

Triple-confirmed against byte-level inspection of ~60 real Workshop scene
packages (20 distinct `PKGV` versions, 3128 entries), the public QuickBMS
extractor script (0.1a), and the BSD-3-licensed RePKG implementation
(behavior references only per ADR 0001 — no code copied):

```text
u32 LE  magic-string length in bytes (8 on the corpus)
bytes   magic string: b"PKGV" + 4 ASCII digits, e.g. "PKGV0001"
u32 LE  entry count
  per entry:
    u32 LE  path length in bytes
    bytes   UTF-8 path, e.g. "scene.json"
    u32 LE  payload offset, relative to the start of the data section
    u32 LE  payload size in bytes
data section: raw concatenated payloads
```

Offsets are relative to the data section (right after the table), and
payloads are stored **raw**: the corpus contains no compressed entry
(JSON descriptors, TEXV0005 textures, and raw pixel data only — verified
with an independent pure-Python LZ4 block decoder), and none of the
reference implementations decompresses anything. The QuickBMS script notes
"PKGV0001, PKGV0006 and so on are all the same format"; the layout is
version-independent, so any `PKGV` + 4 digits is accepted.

### The LZ4 question (honest variant note)

The M3b brief described "LZ4-compressed payloads in the commonly documented
format". The evidence above **disproves that premise** for every package we
can see, so raw is the primary path. To cover the possibility that some
publisher-side tool produced frame-compressed packages, the reader
additionally recognizes the LZ4 frame magic (`04 22 4D 18`) at a payload's
start and decompresses it — with the output cap (64 MiB per entry)
enforced **during** decompression (the frame decoder is wrapped in
`take(cap + 1)`; a declared content size or a bomb can never allocate past
the cap). A payload whose first four bytes are not the frame magic is
returned verbatim. **Raw fallback policy**: a payload that *does* begin
with the frame magic but does not decode as a frame is treated as raw
instead of failing the read (raw is the corpus-proven primary) — one
bounded diagnostic line per fallback; an over-cap decompression is never
downgraded, so a bomb stays a `bounds` error. The `compressed` flag on
`PkgEntry` reports which path a given entry takes.

### Bounds and validation

| Bound | Value |
|---|---|
| package size | 512 MiB |
| entry count | 65 536 |
| entry path | 512 bytes |
| entry payload | 64 MiB (read-time cap, before and during decompression) |
| total payload | 512 MiB (checked while parsing the table) |

The whole table is validated **at open**, before any payload is touched:
magic/version shape (structured `unsupported version` error for a
PKGV-prefixed magic that is not 4 digits), entry count, per-path length and
UTF-8, ranges (`offset + size` inside the data section, checked overflow),
total payload sum, and path safety. The open is TOCTOU-safe like every
other read in kwe-core: lstat (reject symlinks), `O_NOFOLLOW` open, fstat
re-check on the fd, parse from the fd, size re-check after parsing. All
reads stay pinned to the fd.

### Path-traversal policy (documented decision)

M3b ships `read_entry` only — no extract-to-disk API — so a hostile entry
path cannot write outside the package on this slice. The table is still
validated at open: **empty paths, NUL bytes, backslashes, absolute paths,
and `..` components are rejected** (`PathTraversal`), so a future
extractor cannot inherit a hostile table. Callers that resolve entry paths
(the worker's script extraction) additionally confine resolution: the
script reference must be relative, `.js`, and match exactly one entry
(case-insensitive, literal or `/<name>`-suffixed); the extracted file is
always written as `script.js` under a pid-unique 0700 directory the worker
owns. Nothing from a package is ever resolved against the host file
system.

### Worker behavior

* `--content` ending in `.pkg` (case-insensitive) selects the archive path.
* Exactly one entry named exactly `scene.json` (case-insensitive) is
  required, with at most one leading directory component (`scene.json`,
  `dir/scene.json` — `myscene.json` and `a/b/scene.json` do not count):
  zero matches with a `scene.pkg` entry present (same name rule) means a
  **nested archive** (`event=renderer.scene.backend_reject kind=Pkg
  detail="nested scene.pkg inside the package is not supported (M3b)") —
  nested packages are refused, not recursed; zero matches otherwise, or
  several matches, are likewise exit 73. The rule lives in
  `kwe_core::scene_json_entry`, shared with preflight.
* The scene.json entry is read bounded to 16 MiB and parsed by the same
  core as file scenes (unknown keys tolerated, `general` rules identical).
* `general.script` resolves against the package table (same rule as the
  file lane: relative, `.js`, no `..`/backslash/NUL, exactly one match —
  `kwe_core::script_entry`); the entry is read bounded to 2 MiB, extracted,
  and loaded by the script engine. A script reference that is empty, `.pkg`,
  non-`.js`, absolute, traversing, missing from the table, or ambiguous is
  a backend rejection (exit 73).
* Archive failures (corrupt magic/table, truncated data, bounds, traversal
  entries) are backend rejections: `kind=Pkg`, exit 73 before the canary,
  so the supervisor records `exit_code_73` and rolls back. Preflight
  (kwe-core `preflight_scene`) runs the same structural validation for a
  `.pkg` content and rejects a corrupt archive before the worker spawns
  (this closes M1 finding G12, which previously let any `.pkg` through).
  Preflight also checks the renderer's per-entry caps **statically**, with
  the same resolution rules: the scene.json entry must be ≤ 16 MiB and the
  referenced script entry ≤ 2 MiB, so an oversized entry is refused as
  `invalid_params` instead of bouncing workers (exit 73). The script check
  reads the descriptor's stored bytes (never decompressed — preflight
  stays structural; a compressed descriptor skips the check and the
  renderer's bounded decode still enforces the cap).

## Script execution model

One QuickJS runtime + context per worker (rquickjs 0.12.2, MIT, vendored
quickjs-ng 0.15.1 — THIRD_PARTY.yml). Bounds:

| Bound | Value | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| heap | 64 MiB (`Runtime::set_memory_limit`) | JS "Out of memory" exception → bounded `memory_limit` diag → **exit 71** (the renderer never survives an OOM; it cannot render meaningfully) |
| stack | 4 MiB (`Runtime::set_max_stack_size`) | runaway recursion → contained exception, renderer keeps the last state |
| per-update budget | 8 ms soft / 33 ms hard (wall clock in the interrupt callback — rquickjs exposes no step counts; docs/BETA_M3.md risk 1) | soft: frame skipped, bounded `event=renderer.scene.script_timeout kind=soft`; hard: uncatchable exception, counted as `hard_timeout`; the renderer always keeps publishing the last good frame |
| `dt` | clamped to `[0.0, 1.0]` | a hung producer cannot feed a huge dt downstream |
| console | 30 lines per 10 s window, 512 bytes per line | `event=renderer.scene.console`, `console_dropped` on overflow |

Script exceptions are contained: caught, counted (`script_errors` in
`event=renderer.complete`), logged at most once per error class per 30 s
window, and never kill the renderer. `Engine.clearcolor` reads that fall
back on the current color keep a throwing `update()` from corrupting state.

## SceneScript API coverage matrix

Status key: **implemented (M3a)** — in this slice and covered by tests;
*planned* — reserved for M3b–M3k; **not in scope** — explicitly out of the
beta scope. API items follow the behavior of the reference implementations
(see Provenance), restricted to what a worker can do with no window and no
image compositing in M3a.

### Globals

| API | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Engine.frametime` | **implemented (M3a)** | seconds since the previous update, per update (number) |
| `Engine.fps` | **implemented (M3a)** | the pacing the daemon asked for, fixed (number) |
| `Engine.resolution` | **implemented (M3a)** | `{x, y}` — the pixel size the worker renders at, fixed (read-only object) |
| `Engine.clearcolor` | **implemented (M3a)** | `{r, g, b, a}` (0..1 floats). **M3a-only bridge, not a wallpaper-engine API**: the worker reads it back after every `update()` and clears the frame to it. Planned to move to `thisScene.clearcolor` once scene objects arrive. Read-back falls back to the current color on non-finite/missing values. |
| `console.log / info / warn / error` | **implemented (M3a)** | rate-bounded, truncated to 512 bytes, surfaced on the worker's stderr ring |
| `thisScene` | *planned* | with scene objects (M3c–M3k) |
| wallpaper-engine globals beyond `Engine.*` | *planned* / **not in scope** | nothing else exists in M3a; each API joins via the coverage matrix here when implemented |

### Entry points

| API | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `init()` | **implemented (M3a)** | called once at script load, after evaluation; exceptions are contained (the script is still driven) |
| `update(dt)` | **implemented (M3a)** | called once per paced step, `dt` in seconds, clamped to `[0.0, 1.0]`; the return value is ignored (the renderer reads `Engine.clearcolor` back); a missing `update` renders the current color forever |
| `resized(w, h)` | **implemented (M3a)** | called once at script load with the daemon-provided size; dimensions are fixed in M3a — there is no live-resize path (docs/BETA_M3.md risk 7) |

### Scene objects and render model

| API | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Scene.getLayer(name \| index)` | **implemented (M3c)** | returns the `Layer` proxy for a registered layer (image or text), or `null` for an unknown name/index (never throws); layers are registered in `objects` order |
| `Scene.getLayerCount()` | **implemented (M3c)** | the number of registered layers (image and text) |
| `SceneLayer` (`Layer`) | **implemented (M3c, M3d)** | read+write proxy: `name` (read-only string, matching the reference behavior), `alpha` (0..1), `visible` (boolean), `angles` `{x, y, z}` (degrees), `origin` `{x, y}` (scene units, layer center), `scale` `{x, y}`, `size` `{x, y}` (scene units; an absent size is the decoded texture's dimensions, so init() sees the real size). M3d adds `blendMode` (0/1/6/7/9 select the researched modes; 11/12/24/30 clamp to Normal with a bounded diagnostic; anything else clamps silently), `brightness` (0..=10), and `tint` `{r, g, b, a}` (0..=1 each). Writes are clamped like `Engine.clearcolor`: non-finite → 0 (effects → their default 1.0), alpha to 0..=1, scalars to ±1e6, size to ≥ 0 (scale carries the mirror). Changing `image` at runtime is *planned* (M3d+) — an image-less layer registered via `Scene.getLayer` is fully readable/writable except for its texture |
| color effects (`brightness`, `tint`) | **implemented (M3d)** | the effects apply to the sampled texel before blending; clamps absorb any out-of-range write |
| text layers | **implemented (M3e)** | see the Text layers table below |
| particles | **implemented (M3f)** | see the Particles table below |
| `VideoLayer` objects | **implemented (M3g, partial)** | an object with a `video` reference and no `image` is decoded by a supervised libmpv software core; at most two cores are open, native decoded size fills an absent `size`, `loop` and bounded `rate` are accepted, and bad/capped sources skip only that layer. Local file/package containment, protocol whitelist, 160 MiB source cap, `audio=no`, and no scripts/network are intentional semantics. SceneScript per-layer video controls remain planned. |
| 3D models, user properties | *planned* (M3h–M3k) | the parse tolerates extra keys but renders none of them |

### Text layers (M3e)

| API | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Layer.text` | **implemented (M3e)** | read/write string; a write truncates to 4096 chars (one bounded `text_truncated` diagnostic per layer) and rebuilds the geometry |
| `Layer.pointsize` | **implemented (M3e)** | points ×4 → px (the researched WE multiplier), clamped 4..=512; non-finite/≤0 → the default 12 pt (48 px) |
| `Layer.horizontalAlign` / `verticalAlign` | **implemented (M3e)** | 0/1/2 = left\|top / center / right\|bottom, clamped; the parse defaults to center/center (the OWE `horizontalalign` → `alignment` → center chain) |
| `Layer.color` | **implemented (M3e)** | read/write `{r, g, b, a}` 0..=1 per component (clamped at the parse and on every script write; RGB implies alpha 1); the alpha folds into the layer alpha (M3d policy), the RGB rides the draw's tint slot |
| font resolution | **implemented (M3e)** | the Exact → Basename → fallback chain → Any → None order documented in "Text layers (M3e)" above; fallback/none reported once per layer (`text_font_fallback`, `text_font_none`) |
| glyph atlas | **implemented (M3e)** | 2048² per layer, white glyphs with coverage in alpha — zero shader changes; overflow clear+repack rate-limited to 2/s |
| `Layer.size` on a text layer | ignored | text size is automatic (layout pixels map 1:1 to scene units); the write is counted (`text_size_ignored`), resizing goes through `scale` |
| text-bearing wallpapers | *planned* | the corpus carries **zero** text layers and zero textures — nothing real to validate against; M3e is exercised with synthetic fixtures only |
### Particles (M3f)

| API | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Scene.getParticleSystem(name \| index)` | **implemented (M3f)** | returns the `ParticleSystem` proxy for a registered `particle` object, or `null` for an unknown name/index (never throws); the WE-compatible `Scene.getLayer` path reaches particle systems by name too |
| `Scene.getParticleSystemCount()` | **implemented (M3f)** | the number of registered particle systems |
| `ParticleSystem.spawnRate` / `life` / `speedMin` / `speedMax` / `direction` / `spread` / `sizeStart` / `sizeEnd` / `alphaStart` / `alphaEnd` / `maxCount` / `blendMode` | **implemented (M3f)** | read/write scalars, clamped on the Rust side like every proxy write (the scene.json ranges above; non-finite → default, out-of-range → the clamp bound) |
| `ParticleSystem.instance` | **implemented (M3f)** | the WE `IParticleSystemInstance`: `count`, `speed`, `lifetime`, `size`, `alpha`, `rate`, `colorn` — multiplicative factors, default 1.0, non-finite → 1.0, clamped [0, 1e6] (alpha/colorn [0, 1]); `count` scales the spawn rate (the smoke-d lane pins it), `lifetime` scales life, `rate` scales the sim time |
| `ParticleSystem.play()` / `pause()` / `stop()` / `isPlaying()` / `emitParticles(count)` | **implemented (M3f)** | WE semantics: play resumes emission, pause stops emission with live particles still simulating, stop clears immediately, `isPlaying()` = emitting or alive, `emitParticles` (default count 1) bursts even while stopped |
| `ParticleSystem.alpha` / `brightness` | **implemented (M3f)** | read/write like every layer (0..=1 / 0..=10); the drawn effects (read-only in M3f only in the sense that the instance factors are the documented knobs) |
| `particle`-object shared props | **implemented (M3f)** | `origin` positions the emitter; `angles`/`scale` parse but are **not applied** (documented deviation — systems render world-space; the transform is planned) |
| `texture` / `material` | **implemented (M3f)** | M3c image-source resolution (content root or pkg table); `texture` wins over `material`; missing/undecodable → the system simulates but draws nothing (`particle_skip`, never fatal) |
| emitter `direction`/`spread` | **implemented (M3f)** | the M3f extension (WE emitters have neither — launch velocity comes from the velocity-random initializer); radians from +x, spread 0..=2π cone |
| `maxCount` > 4096 / spawn excess | **implemented (M3f)** | excess spawns drop (never evict), one bounded `particles_capped` per system |
| particle-bearing wallpapers | *planned* | the corpus carries **zero** particle systems and zero textures — M3f is exercised with synthetic fixtures only |

| `.pkg` archives | **implemented (M3b)** | scene.json entry parsed in memory; script entry extracted to a private HOME dir; nested archives refused; **image entries resolve against the package table (M3c)** |
| image assets | **implemented (M3c)** | PNG/JPEG (+WebP) decoded from the content root (file scenes) or the package entry table (pkg scenes); a missing/undecodable/over-budget image skips its layer with a bounded diagnostic, never the scene |
| audio/pointer input in script | *planned* | the worker receives and acks the wire inputs but exposes none of them to the script until M3i |
| media input | **implemented (M3g transport only)** | latest-wins `playing`/`paused`/`stopped` fans out to open VideoLayers (stop pauses and seeks to zero); metadata is acknowledged but not exposed to SceneScript |

## Output

Frames are premultiplied BGRA8888 through the shared frame mapping
(docs/FRAME_PROTOCOL_V1.md): a 64-byte `KWEFRM1` header, two BGRA8888
slots, generation-toggle publishing, keepalive re-publish so a script that
never changes the color cannot trip the supervisor's frame timeout. The
Vulkan attachment is `B8G8R8A8_UNORM` when supported (both validated
drivers) with an `R8G8B8A8_UNORM` fallback; the channel conversion is
identity for `B8G8R8A8` readback (bytes are already B,G,R,A) and a
[2,1,0] permutation for `R8G8B8A8`, both premultiplied with
`(v*a+127)/255` rounding — byte-exact per unit test.
