//! Shared classification of a scene.json `objects` array (B2).
//!
//! Both the scene renderer (which builds layers and particle systems from
//! the array) and preflight (which must answer "can this scene draw
//! anything at all?" before an apply transaction runs) need the same
//! answer for the same object. Keeping the rule in one place is what makes
//! the preflight refusal and the renderer's own accounting agree; when the
//! two disagreed, a scene made entirely of features this build lacks was
//! promoted as a healthy wallpaper and the desktop went flat
//! (docs/bugs/SCENE_APPLY_BLANK_CLEAR_COLOR.md).
//!
//! The classification is the researched Wallpaper Engine object model:
//! every visual is stored as a model instance, and the `image` field
//! carries either a texture reference or a `.json` model reference. An
//! object that carries `image` with a NON-string value (the editor's
//! `null`) is not an image at all — the corpus's 65 such objects are all
//! particle systems — so the non-string case falls through to the
//! video/particle/text keys instead of registering a textureless image
//! layer. That fall-through is the classification half of B2.
