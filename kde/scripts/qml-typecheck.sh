# qml-typecheck.sh: the QML type gate for the manager.
#
# Two failures shipped in 0.1.0-alpha.1 because nothing here was enforced:
#
#   1. The five C++ clients carried QML_UNCREATABLE with no QML_ELEMENT, so
#      qmltyperegistrar registered NOTHING (the generated qmltypes was an
#      empty `Module {}`) and every `ApplyClient.Failed`-style read was a
#      runtime ReferenceError that silently killed the binding.
#   2. `qmllint` on PATH is qt5-declarative's qmllint 1.0 on this distro: it
#      cannot resolve a single Qt 6 type and exits 0 on everything, so the
#      old check.sh call was a no-op.
#
# So this script resolves the *Qt 6* qmllint explicitly, asserts the built
# module actually registers its C++ types, and fails on any unresolved TYPE
# (an unqualified identifier starting with an uppercase letter). Unqualified
# *instances* (applyClient, catalogClient, …) are by design — they are
# context properties set in main.cpp, which qmllint cannot see — so they are
# reported as a count and do not fail the gate.
