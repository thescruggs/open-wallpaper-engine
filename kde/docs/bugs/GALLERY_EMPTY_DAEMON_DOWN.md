# Bug: Gallery lists no wallpapers when the user daemon is not running

- **Reported:** 2026-08-19 (user regression report, post test-build install)
- **Severity:** High user-facing (empty gallery reads as total data loss)
- **Status:** FIXED (commit `f9875a73c3603d35a983c6cd443322e109ebe449`, branch `beta-fix-daemon-activation`)

## Fix (2026-08-19)

1. **Manager activation (`apps/kwe-manager/src/daemonactivator.{h,cpp}`).**
   On startup the manager probes the daemon socket
   (`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/kwe/daemon-v1.sock`, same resolution as before, now
   passed to a new `DaemonActivator`): if the socket is live it proceeds as
   today; if absent it runs the activation command through a bounded
   `QProcess` — `systemctl --user start kwe-daemon` by default — 10 s
   timeout per attempt, SIGTERM then SIGKILL after a 1 s grace, no shell,
   max 3 attempts with 1 s → 2 s backoff, then a `Failed` state with the
   actionable message "The background service is not running. Run
   `systemctl --user start kwe-daemon`." One activation cycle per manager
   run; the QML retry action (`Start service`) re-invokes `activate()`.
   The manager never spawns kwe-daemon directly — daemon lifecycle stays
   with systemd. The spawned command inherits the manager environment plus
   `KWE_DAEMON_SOCKET`, so tests/smoke can stub the activation. The
   activation command is injectable via a new `--daemon-activation-command
   <path>` manager CLI flag (default: systemctl as above).
   The catalog load and the activation compose: `DaemonActivator::activated`
   is emitted once the socket is observed, and main.cpp refreshes the
   catalog immediately instead of waiting for the client's exponential
   retry backoff. The manager UI never blocks — the existing
   Error/Loading states show while activation runs, plus two Kirigami
   InlineMessages in GalleryPage: Information while `Activating`, Error
   with the retry action when `Failed`. The stale catalog hint that told
   users to run `systemctl --user enable --now` was replaced by a neutral
   "service is not running" note (DaemonActivator owns the guidance now).
2. **Unit hardening (`packaging/systemd/kwe-daemon.service`).**
   `Restart=on-failure` → `Restart=always` with a comment: clean stops
   (logout teardown) must not leave the desktop without its service;
   `StartLimitBurst=5`/`StartLimitIntervalSec=30s` bound restart loops, and
   an explicit `systemctl --user stop kwe-daemon` still wins. All other
   hardening directives unchanged.
3. **Regression coverage.**
   - `scripts/smoke-ui.sh` now runs a daemon-down case first: no daemon on
     the smoke socket, manager launched offscreen with
     `--smoke-test-ms 3000 --daemon-activation-command <stub>`; the stub
     plays the systemctl role against a smoke daemon (never the user's real
     unit) and records its pid. Asserts the manager exits 0 (catalog Ready
     with totalCount > 0), the daemon socket appeared, and the daemon is
     alive. The pre-running-daemon case runs unchanged afterwards.
   - New C++ test target `kwe-daemon-activator-test` (same style as
     `kwe-workshop-client-test`): activate-when-absent (exactly one
     invocation, socket path delivered via `KWE_DAEMON_SOCKET`),
     no-activate-when-present, bounded attempts then actionable failure,
     QProcess timeout kill (child proven dead), manual retry after failure.
     The tests use stub scripts — no systemctl needed.
   - Evidence: `scripts/smoke-ui.sh` exits 0 with both cases; ctest
     includes the new test; cargo fmt/clippy/test and qmllint green
     (see acceptance run below).
4. **Independent review follow-up (commit `fix(manager): liveness-based
   daemon probe and review findings`).** The probe is a live connect attempt
   (`QLocalSocket::connectToServer` + bounded `waitForConnected`, ECONNREFUSED
   treated as absent), not a file-existence check — a socket file left behind
   by a hard-killed daemon (StartLimitExceeded) can no longer read as
   "running" and skip activation. The catalog Error banner now hides while
   the activator's Failed banner shows (one authoritative banner per root
   cause) and offers the "Start service" action whenever the daemon is not
   known to be up. New unit cases: stale socket at startup activates,
   stale socket during the post-activation probe retries and fails bounded,
   probe-window expiry retries exactly `maxAttempts`, and duplicate
   `activate()` while in flight stacks nothing.

## Symptom

kwe-manager opens with an empty installed gallery. No wallpapers listed,
no crash. The alpha package (same manager code) listed all 92 projects
yesterday.

## Root cause (verified)

1. `systemctl --user status kwe-daemon` → **inactive (dead) since 02:59**
   (clean SIGTERM at session teardown; 7h41m uptime before that).
2. `packaging/systemd/kwe-daemon.service` has `Restart=on-failure` — a clean
   stop is not a failure, so systemd did not bring it back; the unit did not
   come up again on the next session in this case.
3. `apps/kwe-manager/src/main.cpp` contains **no daemon activation path**
   (no spawn, no systemctl, no D-Bus activation) — the manager only connects
   to the existing socket. With the daemon down the catalog request fails
   and the gallery is empty.
4. Not a code regression in the catalog pipeline: `systemctl --user start
   kwe-daemon` → "kwe-daemon ready: 92 projects" and `scripts/smoke-ui.sh`
   passes against it (manager reaches Ready with totalCount > 0).

## Evidence

```
$ systemctl --user status kwe-daemon
○ kwe-daemon.service ... Active: inactive (dead) since Wed 2026-08-19 02:59:28 CDT
$ systemctl --user start kwe-daemon && ... status
● Active: active (running) ... kwe-daemon ready: 92 projects; socket /run/user/1000/kwe/daemon-v1.sock
$ ./scripts/smoke-ui.sh   # offscreen manager + fresh daemon
kwe-daemon ready: 92 projects   # exit 0 (manager Ready + totalCount > 0)
```

## Required fix

1. **Manager activation:** on startup, if the daemon socket is absent,
   activate the user service (prefer `systemctl --user start kwe-daemon`
   via bounded QProcess; graceful fallback when systemd is unavailable —
   no error storm, visible actionable state in the UI).
2. **Unit hardening:** `Restart=always` (StartLimitBurst/IntervalSec already
   bound restart loops; explicit stops still win) so the daemon survives
   clean stops too.
3. Regression coverage: extend `scripts/smoke-ui.sh` with a daemon-down
   case — start the manager with no daemon running, assert the daemon gets
   activated and the gallery reaches Ready within a bounded time.

## Acceptance

- Unit tests for the activation decision logic (socket probe → activate
  once → bounded retries → give up with actionable error).
- smoke-ui daemon-down case green; existing smoke suites unaffected.
- Independent adversarial review of the diff (per AGENTS.md).
